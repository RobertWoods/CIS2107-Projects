   OVER BLACK

   SOUNDS OF THE INNERSPACES RUSHING FORWARD.

   THEN A SPLINTER OF BLUE LIGHT IN THE CENTER OF THE PICTURE.

   IT BREAKS WIDE, SHOWING THE TOP AND BOTTOM A SILHOUETTED
   CURTAIN OF RAZOR SHARP TEETH SUGGESTING THAT WE ARE INSIDE
   OF A TREMENDOUS GULLET, LOOKING OUT AT THE ONRUSHING UNDERSEA
   WORLD AT NIGHT. HEAR A SYMPHONY OF UNDERWATER SOUNDS:
   LANDSLIDE, METABOLIC SOUNDS, THE RARE AND SECRET NOISES THAT
   CERTAIN UNDERSEA SPECIES SHARE WITH EACH OTHER. ALSO, THE
   HINT OF FAMILIAR MUSIC, TWISTED AND DISTORTED BY THE DEPTHS.

                                                        CUT TO:

   EXT. BEACH  NIGHT  SHARK'S POINT OF VIEW  RISING OUT OF
   THE WATER, LOOKING AT

   IT IS A PLEASANT, MOONLIT, WINDLESS NIGHT IN MID-JUNE. WE
   SEE A LONG STRAIGHT STRETCH OF WHITE BEACH. BEHIND THE LOW
   DUNES ARE THE DARK SHAPES OF LARGE EXPENSIVE HOUSES. HEAR A
   NUMBER OF VOICES SINGING. IT SOUNDS LIKE AN EASTERN
   UNIVERSITY'S ALMA MATER, NO LONGER DISTORTED.

   EXT. BEACH  NIGHT  ANOTHER ANGLE

   AROUND A BLAZING BONFIRE, A GROUP OF YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN,
   BEER CANS (OR MAYBE A KEG) IN EVIDENCE, AS WELL AS THE BOTA
   SPANISH LEATHER WINE-BAG MUCH IN FAVOR BY BEACH AND SKI-BUM
   TYPES.

   THE GROUP IS SWAPPING SENTIMENTAL ALMA MATERS, WEEPILY SINGING
   EASTERN IVY LEAGUE ANTHEMS - DARTMOUTH, CORNELL, HARVARD,
   PENN, ETC. TWO YOUNG PEOPLE BREAK AWAY FROM THE OTHERS. THEY

   ARE TOM CASSIDY AND CHRISSIE. BEHIND THEM, THERE IS
   CONSIDERABLE NECKING ACTIVITY; TOM AND CHRISSIE ARE MORE
   SERIOUS.

   TOM

   MAKES A CLUMSY ATTEMPT AT SNARING CHRISSIE, CUPS HER FROM
   BEHIND. SHE SQUIRMS PLAYFULLY OUT OF HIS GRASP. WE DISCOVER
   HE'S NOT ESPECIALLY SOBER.

                         TOM
             HEY! HEY HEY! I'M WITH YOU, RIGHT?

   EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE BEACH  NIGHT

   TOM AND CHRISSIE ARE SEPARATED FROM THE OTHERS, SILHOUETTED
   AGAINST THE FIRE, SHE PAUSES AND LOOKS AT THE OCEAN, HE IS
   PLODDING ALONG IN THE SAND, WINDED.

   CHRISSIE RUNS DOWN THE SLOPE OF THE DUNE TOWARDS THE WATER,
   LEAVING TOM REELING ATOP THE DUNE. AS SHE RUNS, SHE IS
   SHEDDING HER CLOTHES. TOM IS TRYING TO TRAIL HER BY HER
   CLOTHES, LIKE HANSEL FOLLOWING BREAD CRUMBS THROUGH THE WOODS.

   BUT CHRISSIE IS WAY AHEAD OF HIM.

                         CHRISSIE
             C'MON!

   SHE RUNS HEADLONG INTO THE INVITING SEA, PLUNGES CLEANLY
   INTO THE WATER WITH A LIGHT "WHOOPS!" AS THE COLD WATER SWEEPS
   OVER HER.

   BEHIND ALL THIS, WE CONTINUE TO HEAR THE SENTIMENTAL, BEERY
   CHORUS OF ALMA MATERS.

   THEN WE SEE IT -- A GENTLE BULGE IN THE WATER, A RIPPLE THAT
   PASSES HER A DOZEN FEET AWAY. A PRESSURE WAVE LIFTS HER UP,
   THEN EASES HER DOWN AGAIN, LIKE A SMOOTH, SUDDEN SWELL.

                         CHRISSIE
             TOMMY? DON'T DUNK ME...

   SHE LOOKS AROUND FOR HIM, FINDS HIM STILL ON THE BEACH, HIS
   FEET TANGLED IN HIS PANTS, WHICH HAVE DROPPED AROUND HIS
   ANKLES. SHE STARTS TO SWIM BACK IN TO HIM.

   EXT. CHRISSIE IN THE WATER

   HER EXPRESSION FREEZES. THE WATER-BULGE IS RACING TOWARDS
   HER. THE FIRST BUMP JOLTS HER UPRIGHT, OUT OF THE WATER TO
   HER HIPS. SHE REACHES UNDER WATER TO TOUCH HER LEG. WHATEVER
   SHE FEELS MAKES HER OPEN HER MOUTH TO SCREAM, BUT SHE IS
   SLAMMED AGAIN, HARD, WHIPPED INTO AN ARC OF ABOUT EIGHT FEET,
   UP AND DOWN, SUBMERGING HER DOWN TO HER OPEN MOUTH, CHOKING
   OFF ANY SCREAM SHE MIGHT TRY TO MAKE. ANOTHER JOLT TO HER
   BODY, DRIVING HER UNDER SO THAT ONLY HER HAIR SWIRLS ON THE
   SURFACE. THEN IT TOO IS SUCKED BELOW IN A FINAL AND TERRIBLE
   JERKING MOTION. HOLD ON THE EDDIES AND SWIRLS UNTIL WE'RE
   SURE IT'S ALL OVER.

   EXT. CLOSE ON TOM ON BEACH

   IN HIS SHORTS, LAUGHING TO HIMSELF, TURNING IN SLOW STONED
   CIRCLES, HELD PRISONER BY HIS WINDBREAKER WHICH SEEMS TO
   HAVE HIM IN AN ARMLOCK, AS HE STRUGGLES TO FREE HIS ARM FROM
   A TIGHT SLEEVE. AS HE TURNS, WE HEAR THE ALMA MATERS IN THE
   BACKGROUND, FROM THE FIRE.

   INT. BRODY HOUSE - BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

   A SHAFT OF MORNING SUN BLASTS THROUGH THE CRACK BETWEEN THE
   BOTTOM OF THE SHADE AND THE WINDOWSILL, FALLING ACROSS THE
   HEADS OF THE SLEEPING COUPLE ON THE BED. IT CATCHES MARTIN
   BRODY RIGHT ACROSS THE EYES, BRINGING HIM UP FROM SLEEP.
   THE JOB IS COMPLETED BY THE CLOCK RADIO, WHICH CLICKS ON
   WITH LOCAL FISHERMAN'S REPORT AND WEATHER.

                         RADIO ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
             HAYES LANDING REPORTS CONDITIONS
             GOOD, WITH STRIPERS AND JACKS. THE
             COAST GUARD HAS NO STORM WARNING
             FROM BLOCK ISLAND TO CAPE HATTERAS;
             A LIGHT CHOP WITH FRESHENING WINDS,
             CONTINUED CLEAR AND MILD... (ETC.)

   ELLEN BRODY BURROWS HER HEAD UNDER THE COVERS, AVOIDING
   MORNING FOR A FEW PRECIOUS MINUTES MORE.

                         BRODY
             HOW COME THE SUN DIDN'T USED TO SHINE
             IN HERE?

                         ELLEN
             'CAUSE WHEN WE BOUGHT THE HOUSE IT
             WAS AUTUMN. THIS IS SUMMER. FEED THE
             DOGS.

   WE HEAR THE SCAMPERING TOENAILS OF TWO COCKER SPANIELS
   SCRABBLING AROUND THE FOOT OF THE BED. BRODY SWINGS OUT OF
   BED, WEARING SHORTS, SOCKS, AND TEE SHIRT.

                         BRODY
             RIGHT.

                         ELLEN
             DO YOU SEE THE KIDS?

                         BRODY
             PROBABLY OUT IN THE BACK YARD.

                         ELLEN
             IN AMITY, YOU SAY 'YAHD.'
                  (SHE GIVES IT THE
                  BOSTON SOUND)

                         BRODY
             THE KIDS ARE IN THE YAHD, PLAYING
             NEAR THE CAH. HOW'S THAT SOUND?

                         ELLEN
             LIKE YOU'RE FROM N'YAWK.
                  (GIVES IT BROOKLYN
                  SOUND)

                         BRODY
             GIVE ME 30 YEARS, I'LL GET IT.

   HE LEADS THE DOGS OUT OF THE BEDROOM AND DOWN TO THE KITCHEN.

   INT. BRODY KITCHEN - MORNING

   BRODY ENTERS, SETS DOWN SOME DOG FOOD, GOES TO MAKE COFFEE,
   STARTS TO FILL KETTLE TO BOIL WATER, THE COLD WATER RUSHES
   THROUGH AND OUT THE BURNT-OUT BOTTOM OF THE KETTLE.

                         BRODY
             DID YOU BURN ANOTHER KETTLE? Y'KNOW
             YOU'RE A FIRE HAZARD? THIS IS THE
             THIRD ONE!

                         ELLEN (O.S.)
             I NEVER HEAR THE WHISTLE.

                         BRODY
             FEED THE DOGS.

   ELLEN BRODY, A TALL, ATTRACTIVE BLONDE WOMAN, ENTERS FROM
   UPSTAIRS. SHE'S STILL SLIGHTLY SLEEPY, NOT WHAT YOU'D CALL
   AN "INSTANT-ON" PERSON. MORNINGS ARE NOT HER BEST TIME.

                         ELLEN
             YOU WANT TO GO THROUGH THOSE?
                  (SHE INDICATES BAG OF
                  CLOTHES)
             I'M TAKING THEM TO THE THRIFT SHOP.
             IT'S MARCIA VAUGHN'S PET CHARITY.
             PICK OUT WHAT YOU WANT TO KEEP --
             IT'S MOSTLY YOUR CITY CLOTHES.

                         BRODY
                  (LOOKING THROUGH BAG,
                  REMEMBERING)
             I USED TO WEAR THIS TO THE GARDEN.
             GARBAGE STRIKES. DOG SHIT. MUGGERS.
                  (HE PUTS IT ALL BEHIND)
             SHIP IT.

                         ELLEN
             DON'T BE SILLY - YOU'RE GOING TO
             MAKE SUMMER BETTER FOR THEM...

   BEFORE BRODY CAN ANSWER, MICHAEL, HIS OLDEST BOY, ENTERS,
   HOLDING HIS HAND. THERE IS BRIGHT NEW BLOOD ON IT, BUT HE IS
   SENSIBLY UNCONCERNED. IT'S A NORMAL CHILDHOOD SCRAPE.

                         MICHAEL
             CUT MY HAND. HIT BY A VAMPIRE.

                         BRODY
             ON THE SWING? I TOLD YOU NOT TO PLAY
             NEAR THERE UNTIL I SANDED IT DOWN.
                  (TO ELLEN)
             SEE WHAT YOUR SON DID?

                         ELLEN
             GO UPSTAIRS AND BRING MOMMY A BAND-
             AID.

   MICHAEL GOES ON OUT AND UPSTAIRS. ELLEN FUMBLES IN HER POCKET
   AND PRODUCES BRODY'S NEW GLASSES, WHICH SHE HOLDS OUT TO
   HIM.

                         ELLEN
             DON'T FORGET THESE.

                         BRODY
             OH, YEAH.
                  (HE PUTS THEM ON)
             HOW DO I LOOK? OLDER, HUH?

                         ELLEN
             I THINK THEY MAKE YOU LOOK SEXY.

   BRODY REACTS TO THIS, AND BENDS TO KISS HER LIGHTLY. THEN
   MORE SERIOUSLY.

                         BRODY
             SEXY, HM? WHAT WAS I BEFORE?

                         ELLEN
             OLDER, SILLIER.

                         BRODY
                  (AS HE GOES TO MAKE
                  COFFEE, HE FUMBLES
                  WITH THE NEW GLASSES)
             I DON'T WANT TO DEPEND ON THESE
             THINGS, Y'KNOW - SOMETIMES YOU CAN
             WEAKEN YOUR EYES.

   HE LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW TO THE VIEW BEYOND, DISCOVERING SOME
   NEW WONDER IN THE FRESH SUNLIT MORNING.

   BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW  OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

   SEAN, THE YOUNGER CHILD, IS HAPPILY ROMPING IN THE SUMMER
   AIR, ENJOYING THE VERY AIR HE BREATHES.

                         BRODY
             LET'S SEE...

   THE PHONE RINGS.

   INT. BRODY KITCHEN  DAY

   BRODY ANSWERS ONE OF TWO PHONES ON THE WALL.

                         BRODY
             BRODY... YEAH, WHAT'S UP... MMM...
             WELL, WHAT DO THEY USUALLY DO, FLOAT
             OR WASH UP? REALLY?... OKAY, I'LL
             MEET BOTH OF YOU AT THE BEACH IN
                  (CHECKS WATCH)
             ...20 MINUTES, OKAY? OKAY.
                  (HANGS UP)
             FIRST GODDAMN WEEKEND OF THE SUMMER.

   MICHAEL REENTERS IN BATHING TRUNKS, WITH A TOWEL ON HIS
   SHOULDER, HIS HAND WASHED, HOLDING A BAND-AID READY FOR
   APPLICATION. ELLEN TAKES IT, AND BANDAGES THE FINGER WITH
   CARE AND AFFECTION.

                         ELLEN
             THERE.
                  (TO BRODY)
             WHAT WAS THAT?

   MICHAEL HEADS TOWARD THE BEACH.

                         BRODY
                  (STRUGGLING TO GET
                  HIS SHIRT ON OVER
                  HIS GLASSES)
             THE OFFICE.

   HE GETS HIS SHIRT ON WITH ELLEN'S HELP. SHE FLICKS IMAGINARY
   DUST FROM THE BADGE ON HIS CHEST.

                         ELLEN
             BE CAREFUL.

                         BRODY
             HERE? YOU GOTTA BE KIDDIN'.

   HE GIVES HER A LIGHT KISS, STARTS TO GO, WITH HIS CUP.

                         BRODY
             LOVE YA.

                         ELLEN
                  (KISSING HIM BACK)
             HEY CHIEF. BRING MY CUP BACK.

   AT THE DOOR, HE TAKES A WINDBREAKER OFF A PEG AND GOES ON
   OUT.

   WE CAN SEE THE AMITY POLICE SHOULDER PATCH AS HE GOES TO A
   VAN PARKED OUTSIDE.

   EXT. ISLAND HIGHWAY - MORNING

   MARTIN BRODY'S COUNTRY SQUIRE POLICE WAGON RUSHES PAST, TAKING
   THE VIEW TO AN ENORMOUS BILLBOARD DEPICTING A TYPICAL SUMMER
   DAY IN AMITY. A BEAUTIFUL MODEL SPLASHES IN THE GOLD SURF,
   LANGUISHING IN A SOLARCAINE SUN. AMITY WELCOMES YOU IS WRITTEN
   ABOVE HER FLAILING ARMS.

   EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

   THREE SMALL FIGURES IN THE LANDSCAPE, WALKING THE BEACH. THE
   SURF IS ROUGH AND THERE IS SEA-FLOOR DEBRIS STREWN ABOUT
   FROM THE RECEDING TIDE.

   CLOSER ANGLE

   DEPUTY HENDRICKS IS SEARCHING THE SHORE ABOUT ONE HUNDRED
   YARDS DOWN WIND. MEANWHILE, BRODY, IN HIS CASUAL POLICE
   ATTIRE, AND TOM CASSIDY, STILL IN THE CLOTHING WE SAW HIM IN
   LAST NIGHT, WALK DOWN THE BEACH. BRODY FINGERS THE MISSING
   GIRL'S SHOES, PURSE AND CLOTHES. IN THE DAYLIGHT, CASSIDY
   MISCONDUCTS HIMSELF, WAVERING BETWEEN INFLATED MATURITY AND
   TEAR-BLOWN ADOLESCENCE.

                         BRODY
             CHRISTINE WHAT?

                         CASSIDY
             WORTHINGSLY... WORTHINGTON -- NO ONE
             EVER DIED ON ME BEFORE.

                         BRODY
             YOU PICKED HER UP ON THE FERRY.

                         CASSIDY
             I DIDN'T KNOW HER.

                         BRODY
             AND NOBODY ELSE SAW HER IN THE WATER?

                         CASSIDY
             SOMEBODY COULD'VE -- I WAS SORT OF
             PASSED OUT.

                         BRODY
             THINK SHE MIGHT'VE RUN OUT ON YOU?

                         CASSIDY
             OH, NO, SIR. I'VE NEVER HAD A WOMAN
             DO THAT. I'M SURE SHE DROWNED.

                         BRODY
             YOU FROM AROUND HERE?

                         CASSIDY
             NO. CAMBRIDGE. HARVARD. MY FAMILY'S
             IN TUXEDO, NEW YORK, THOUGH.

                         BRODY
             YOU HERE FOR THE SUMMER?

                         CASSIDY
             SOME FRIENDS AND ME TOOK A HOUSE.

                         BRODY
                  (GENUINELY CURIOUS)
             WHAT D'YOU PAY FOR A PLACE JUST FOR
             THE SUMMER?

                         CASSIDY
             A THOUSAND APIECE, SOMETHING LIKE
             THAT. THERE'S FIVE OF US. AND WE
             EACH KICK IN A HUNDRED A WEEK FOR
             BEER AND CLEANING, STUFF LIKE THAT.

                         BRODY
             PRETTY STIFF.

   A SHRILL WHISTLE MAKES THEM TURN. HENDRICKS IS FIFTY YARDS
   AWAY, ON HIS KNEES. HE BLOWS AGAIN, A FEEBLE REPORT THIS
   TIME.

                         BRODY
             MAYBE THAT'S YOUR GIRL.

   BRODY RUNS TOWARD HENDRICKS, CASSIDY HESITATES, THEN FOLLOWS
   WITH:

                         CASSIDY
                  (PATHETICALLY)
             YOU CAN'T MAKE ME LOOK -- !

   MASTER ANGLE - THE SAND DUNE

   A SKEIN OF SEAWEED GARNISHES THE BASE OF THIS ISOLATED DUNE.

   THE BOOMING WAVES AND FIZZING SURF MAKE DIALOGUE INAUDIBLE.

   DEPUTY HENDRICKS ON HANDS AND KNEES, LOOKING WHITE AS A SHEET.
   BRODY TELLS CASSIDY TO WAIT AT THE FOOT OF THE DUNE, AND
   VENTURES UP. HENDRICKS STOPS HIM WITH A WAVE-OFF, SAYING
   SOMETHING AT THE SAME TIME. BRODY NODS UNDERSTANDING AND
   STEPS UP CAUTIOUSLY AND LOOKS DOWN. HE ADJUSTS HIS GLASSES,
   TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF WHAT HE IS LOOKING AT.

   WHATEVER HE SEES HAS A MARKED EFFECT ON HIS ENTIRE PHYSIQUE.

   KICKING OUT WITH HIS FOOT, BRODY SENDS DOZENS OF ANGRY
   HORSESHOE CRABS INTO AN ESCAPE FRENZY AND THEY BOIL OVER THE
   TOP OF THE DUNE AND DOWN ITS SLOPES.

   CASSIDY TAKES A FEW UNEASY STEPS BACKWARDS WHEN BRODY WAVES
   HIM OVER. HE SHAKES HIS HEAD. AN AWKWARD MOMENT. THEN CASSIDY
   SHUFFLES FORWARD AND UP THE FEW REMAINING FEET, HIS EYES
   LOOKING EVERYWHERE BUT DOWN. BRODY SAYS SOMETHING ELSE AND
   CASSIDY SHAKES HIS HEAD AGAIN, EYES OUT AT SEA. BRODY PUTS
   HIS HAND GENTLY AROUND THE QUAKING MAN'S SHOULDER.

   NODDING, HE STARTS TO LOOK DOWN, AN INCH AT A TIME. HE LOOKS.

   HE, TOO, CAN'T MAKE OUT WHAT IT IS AT FIRST. THEN HE
   UNDERSTANDS.

   THE JOLT THAT ASSAULTS CASSIDY IS NOT UNEXPECTED. HE FALLS
   BACKWARD IN A SITTING POSITION AS THOUGH SHOT. NODS YES --
   IT'S HER. BRODY TURNS AND SLIDES OFF THE DUNE, STUMBLING
   CLOSE. HEAR HIS BREATHING. HE LOOKS AROUND, ENVISIONING THE
   WEEK AHEAD OF HIM....

   QUICK SHARP CUT

   CHRISSIE'S REMAINS, INCOMPLETE FROM THE CHEST DOWN, HORRIBLY
   BITTEN. (NOTE: SEE HOOPER'S DIALOG IN SC. 91 FOR COMPLETE
   DESCRIPTION OF CORPSE.)

   INT. BRODY'S OFFICE - DAY

   BRODY WALKS THROUGH THE DOOR AND ENTERS HIS OFFICE, HOLDING
   A FIZZING GLASS OF ALKA-SELTZER. POLLY, HIS SIXTY-ONE YEAR
   OLD SECRETARY FOLLOWS CLOSE ON HIS HEELS WITH HER SHORTHAND
   PAD OF MESSAGES AND REMINDERS.

   IN THE OUTER OFFICE, HENDRICKS AND CASSIDY SLUMP INTO CHAIRS,
   SIPPING FROM FIZZING DIXIE CUPS.

   BRODY DIPS INTO FILE DRAWERS FOR THE APPROPRIATE FORMS. HE
   GENTLY TURNS ON POLLY, WHO IS BEHIND HIM.

                         BRODY
             IF THIS IS GOING TO WORK, YOU'VE GOT
             TO KEEP CURRENT STUFF OUT HERE, AND
             PUT 'CLOSED' FILES IN THERE. THE
             'PENDINGS' STAY ON MY DESK, OKAY?

   BRODY SLIPS BEHIND HIS TYPEWRITER, PUTTING PAPER IN THE
   MACHINE WITH THE EFFORTLESS EASE OF YEARS OF PRACTICE. HE'S
   OBVIOUSLY NO STRANGER TO PAPERWORK. HE TOUCH TYPES, HARDLY
   EVER LOOKING DOWN, CHECKING HIS NOTES AND LISTENING WITH ONE
   EAR TO POLLY.

   HE IS AFFECTED BY WHAT HE'S SEEN, BUT THERE'S WORK TO BE
   DONE.

                         POLLY
             THIS IS IN NO ORDER OF IMPORTANCE,
             CHIEF: THERE'S A MEETING ON THE AMITY
             TOWN COUNCIL ON AGING THIS MONDAY
             NIGHT, BENTONCOURT HALL. THE FIRE
             INSPECTOR WANTS YOU TO GO OVER THE
             FIREWORKS SITE WITH HIM BEFORE HE
             CATCHES THE ONE O'CLOCK FERRY. MAINLY,
             YOU HAVE A BATCH OF CALLS ABOUT THAT
             NEW KARATE SCHOOL.

   CLOSE - ACCIDENT REPORT

   BRODY HAS JUST TYPED THE GIRL'S NAME. HE SKIPS THE SPACE FOR
   CAUSE-OF-DEATH, AND JUST UNDER IT TYPES THE NEXT-OF-KIN
   INFORMATION HE HAS COLLECTED FROM HER WALLET.

                         POLLY
             SEARLE'S RENT-A-BIKE, THE RAINY ALE,
             TISBERRY'S HARDWARE... THEY SAY IT'S
             THOSE NINE-YEAR-OLDS FROM THE SCHOOL
             PRACTICING KARATE ON ALL THOSE NICE
             PICKET FENCES.

   THE PHONE RINGS AND POLLY PICKS IT UP.

                         POLLY
             IT'S THE CORONER. SOMEBODY PASS AWAY
             IN THE NIGHT?

   BRODY NESTLES THE PHONE BETWEEN EAR AND COLLAR, LISTENING,
   AS HE TURNS TO THE TYPEWRITER.

                         BRODY
             JESUS, SANTOS.

   INSERT - ACCIDENT REPORT

   CAUSE-OF-DEATH LINE ROLLS INTO PLACE. THE HAMMERS PUNCH OUT:
   SHARK ATTACK.

   BRODY

   LEANS FORWARD, STARING AT WHAT HE JUST WROTE. POLLY COCKS
   HER HEAD AND REMOVES THE PHONE FROM HIS EAR.

                         POLLY
             WHAT'S THE MATTER?

   BRODY TAKES A BREATH. A NEW RESOLVE COMES OVER HIM.

                         BRODY
             POLLY, I WANT TO KNOW WHAT WATER
             RECREATION IS ON FOR TODAY.

                         POLLY
             RIGHT THIS MINUTE?

   BRODY GETS UP AND MOVES HASTILY TOWARD THE DOOR.

   BRODY'S OUTER OFFICE

   CASSIDY AND HENDRICKS LOOK UP AS BRODY ENTERS.

                         BRODY
                  (TO HENDRICKS)
             WHERE'D YOU HIDE THE 'BEACH CLOSED'
             SIGNS?

                         HENDRICKS
             WE NEVER HAD ANY. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

   A LOCAL MERCHANT COMES THROUGH THE DOOR.

                         LOCAL MERCHANT
             GLAD I CAUGHT YOU. THERE'S A CITY
             TRUCK WITH NEW HAMPSHIRE PLATES PARKED
             RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY...

   BRODY PUSHES PAST HIM AND OUT THE DOOR.

   EXT. AMITY MAIN STREET  DAY

   IN THE BUSY CENTER OF A TOWN PREPARING FOR THE BIG FOURTH OF
   JULY WEEKEND, BRODY WENDS HIS WAY AROUND SIDEWALK ACTIVITY,
   PURPOSE AND HASTE IN EACH STRIDE. AS HE TURNS A CORNER A
   LITTLE MAN IN A WHITE SMOCK EMERGES FROM THE FUNERAL PARLOR.

   THIS IS CARL SANTOS, AMITY'S PART-TIME CORONER. SANTOS LOOKS
   BOTH WAYS BEFORE CROSSING COLONIAL DRIVE.

   BRODY PASSES KEISEL'S BICYCLE RENTAL, NAVIGATING AN AWKWARD
   COURSE THROUGH AN ODD ASSORTMENT OF SCHWINNS THAT LINE THE
   SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF A DEMOLISHED WHITE PICKET FENCE. KEISEL
   INTERCEPTS BRODY ON THE RUN.

                         KEISEL
                  (HE STARES AT BRODY'S
                  FACE)
             WAIT-A-MINUTE.
                  (STARES SOME MORE)
             GLASSES, RIGHT?

   BRODY NODS YES, AND STARTS TO MOVE AWAY, BUT KEISEL HOLDS ON
   TO HIM.

                         KEISEL
             LOOK AT THOSE FENCES! LITTLE GUYS
             ABOUT EIGHT TO TEN YEARS OLD. AND
             LOOK AT THIS!

   HE HOLDS UP BICYCLE. THE BICYCLE'S SPOKES ARE BENT AND BROKEN
   FROM SOME SORT OF BLOWS.

                         KEISEL
             THEY DID THAT WITH THEIR BARE HANDS.

                         BRODY
             CALL ME LATER IN THE DAY, OKAY, HARRY?

   ANGLE - AMITY GAZETTE NEWSPAPER OFFICE - PORCH

   SANTOS EMERGES WITH BEN MEADOWS, THE STYLISH, LATE-THIRTIES
   EDITOR OF THE AMITY GAZETTE. TOGETHER THEY CUT A BEELINE FOR
   THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET.

   ANGLE - AMITY STREET

   PAST TAVERNS AND CHOWDER SHACKS, PAST BLEACHER CONSTRUCTION
   AND JULY FOURTH POSTERS, BRODY ENTERS HARDWARE AND SPORTING
   GOODS... SO OVERSTOCKED THAT BEACH UMBRELLAS, ALUMINUM DECK
   CHAIRS, AND RAINBOW BEACH TOWELS SPLASH A SURPLUS OF COLOR
   FROM THE DISPLAY WINDOW TO THE SIDEWALK.

   INT. HARDWARE STORE  DAY

   THE STORE PROPRIETOR IS BUSY AT WORK ON AN INVENTORY LIST
   WITH A MAINLAND DELIVERY MAN.

                         LYNWOOD
             STUFF'S NO GOOD TO ME IN AUGUST WHEN
             THE PILGRIMS COME IN JUNE...
                  (TO BRODY)
             GO ON AND HELP YOURSELF TO WHATEVER
             YOU NEED, CHIEF. CAN YOU WORK THE
             REGISTER?

   EXT. HARDWARE STORE AND STREET - DAY

   BRODY EMERGES WITH ENOUGH POSTER-BOARD, WOODEN STAKES, NAILS,
   PAINT, AND BRUSHES TO CLOSE EVERY BEACH ON THE ISLAND. HE
   STARTS BACK THE WAY HE CAME WHEN HENDRICKS SHOOTS UP THE
   STREET IN THE PATROL JEEP. HE STOPS FAST ENOUGH TO CALL
   ATTENTION, LEANS OUT THE WINDOW.

                         HENDRICKS
             POLLY TOLD ME TO TELL YOU THERE'S A
             SCOUT TROOP IN AVRIL BAY DOING THE
             MILE SWIM FOR THEIR MERIT BADGES. I
             COULDN'T CALL THEM IN, THERE'S NO
             PHONE OUT THERE.

                         BRODY
                  (HANDS HIM THE SIGN
                  MATERIAL)
             GET OUT OF THERE  TAKE THESE BACK
             TO THE OFFICE AND MAKE UP SOME 'BEACH
             CLOSED' SIGNS, AND LET POLLY DO THE
             PRINTING.

                         HENDRICKS
             WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH MY PRINTING?

   EXT. VAUGHN'S REALTY  DAY

   REVEALING LARRY VAUGHN, THE MAYOR OF AMITY, EXCHANGING
   ANXIETIES WITH BEN MEADOWS AND CORONER SANTOS AND TWO OTHER
   CITY SELECTMEN. THEY COME OUT IN A GROUP, REACH THE SUNLIGHT,
   AND SQUINT DOWN THE STREET AS BRODY CAREENS AROUND THE CORNER
   AND OUT OF SIGHT. DEPUTY HENDRICKS, LADEN WITH HIS ARTS AND
   CRAFTS, PASSES THEM ON THE STREET FRONT.

                         VAUGHN
             WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE, LENNY?

                         HENDRICKS
             WE HAD A SHARK ATTACK AT SOUTH CHOP
             THIS MORNING, MAYOR. FATAL. GOTTA
             BATTEN DOWN THE BEACH.

   VAUGHN AND GROUP EXCHANGE HORRIFIED LOOKS, BUT WE GET THE
   IMPRESSION IT IS NOT IN RESPONSE TO THE SHARK-ATTACK NEWS.

                         VAUGHN
             WHO'VE YOU TOLD THIS TO, LENNY?

                         HENDRICKS
             I JUST FOUND OUT ABOUT IT -- BUT
             THERE'S A BUNCH OF BOY SCOUTS IN THE
             WATER A COUPLA MILES DOWN THE COAST
             FROM WHERE WE FOUND THE GIRL. AVRIL
             BAY, THEREABOUTS. CHIEF WENT TO DRY
             THEM OFF.

                         VAUGHN
                  (TO MEADOWS)
             TAKE MY CAR, OKAY?
                  (TO HENDRICKS)
             YOU COME WITH US, LENNY.

                         HENDRICKS
             I'VE GOT ALL THESE SIGNS HERE...

                         VAUGHN
             C'MON, IT'LL GIVE US TIME TO THINK
             ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO SAY.

   THEY ALL CROWD INTO A CADILLAC EL DORADO WITH VAUGHN REALTY
   SIGNS ON THE DOORS.

   EXT. AVRIL BAY - DAY

   A FLOTILLA OF TWENTY EXHAUSTED BOY SCOUTS ROUND A BUOY THAT
   MARKS THE OFFICIAL COURSE. A ROWBOAT WITH SCOUTMASTER USING
   A BULLHORN KEEPS PACE, AND URGES THE BOYS ON.

                         SCOUTMASTER
                  (BULLHORN EFFECT)
             LET'S GO, ROBBIE. YOU TOO, HOFNER.
             BOYLE, KEEP YOUR HEAD UP. ALBERTS,
             KEEP KICKING...
                  (ETC., AD LIB)

   EXT. ON THE BEACH AT AVRIL BAY - DAY

   TWO OLDER SEASCOUTS LOOK ON WITH STOP WATCHES AND CLIPBOARDS,
   WHILE SOME PARENTS SHADE THEIR EYES FROM THE SUN, WATCHING
   THEIR OFFSPRING. BRODY PULLS UP IN THE AMITY POLICE JEEP,
   AND STARTS TOWARD THE PEOPLE. BEHIND HIM, VAUGHN'S CADILLAC
   PULLS UP AND SKIDS TO A STOP. IN IT ARE VAUGHN, MEADOWS, THE
   DOCTOR, MAYBE A SELECTMAN, AND HENDRICKS, WITH HIS ARMS STILL
   FULL OF SIGN MATERIAL. VAUGHN INTERCEPTS BRODY, THE OTHERS
   CIRCLE AROUND HIM, EFFECTIVELY SLOWING HIS PROGRESS THROUGH
   THE SAND TO THE SCOUTS.

                         VAUGHN
             MARTIN!
                  (HE CATCHES UP WITH
                  HIM)
             ARE YOU GOING TO SHUT DOWN THE BEACH
             ON YOUR OWN AUTHORITY?

                         BRODY
             DO I NEED ANY MORE AUTHORITY?

                         MEADOWS
             TECHNICALLY, YOU NEED THE INSTRUCTION
             OF A CIVIC ORDINANCE, OR A SPECIAL
             MEETING OF THE TOWN SELECTMEN...

                         VAUGHN
                  (THE GOOD GUY)
             THAT'S JUST GOING BY THE BOOK. WE'RE
             JUST A LITTLE ANXIOUS THAT YOU'RE
             RUSHING INTO SOMETHING SERIOUS HERE.
             THIS IS YOUR FIRST SUMMER.

                         BRODY
             NOW TELL ME SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW.

                         VAUGHN
             ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT AMITY IS A
             SUMMER TOWN -- WE NEED SUMMER DOLLARS,
             AND IF THEY CAN'T SWIM HERE, THEY'LL
             USE THE BEACHES AT CAPE COD, OR LONG
             ISLAND.

                         BRODY
             SO WE SHOULD SET OUT A SMORGASBORD?

                         MEADOWS
             WE'RE NOT EVEN SURE WHAT IT WAS.

                         BRODY
             WHAT ELSE COULD'VE DONE THAT?

                         VAUGHN
                  (TO DOCTOR)
             BOAT PROPELLER?

                         DOCTOR
             I THINK, POSSIBLY... SURE. A BOATING
             ACCIDENT.

                         VAUGHN
             SOME WEEKEND TRAMP ACCIDENTALLY GOES
             SWIMMING TOO FAR, SHE'S A LITTLE
             DRUNK, A FISHING BOAT COMES ALONG --

                         MEADOWS
             REMEMBER WHEN FRED GANZ WENT
             SCALLOPING IN HIS BVD'S? HE WAS GOING
             TO SWIM TO NEW BEDFORD, HE SAID.

   THE MEN ALL LAUGH, AD LIB THEIR REMEMBRANCES OF THIS
   FOOLISHNESS.

                         MEADOWS
             ...AND BILL MAYHEW ALMOST CAUGHT HIM
             IN HIS NET...?

                         BRODY
                  (INTERRUPTING THE
                  MERRIMENT)
             DOCTOR, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TOLD ME
             WHAT IT WAS!

                         DOCTOR
             I WAS WRONG. WE'LL HAVE TO AMEND THE
             REPORT.

                         MEADOWS
             WE NEVER HAD THAT KIND OF TROUBLE
             HERE.

                         VAUGHN
             I DON'T THINK YOU CAN APPRECIATE THE
             GUT REACTION PEOPLE HAVE TO THESE
             THINGS.

                         BRODY
             I WAS ONLY REACTING TO WHAT I WAS
             TOLD.

   BRODY LOOKS OUT TO THE WATER WHERE THE SCOUTS ARE ROUNDING
   ANOTHER BUOY ON THE HOME STRETCH.

                         VAUGHN
                  (TAKING BRODY ASIDE)
             IT'S ALL PSYCHOLOGICAL, ANYWAY. YOU
             YELL 'BARRACUDA' AND EVERYONE SAYS
             'HUH'. YOU YELL 'SHARK' AND WE'VE
             GOT A PANIC ON OUR HANDS. I THINK WE
             ALL AGREE WE DON'T NEED A PANIC THIS
             CLOSE TO THE 4TH OF JULY.

   VAUGHN INDICATES THE BEACH WHERE THE SCOUTS ARE FLOPPING OUT
   ONTO THE SAND, EXHAUSTED, GLAD TO BE FINISHED.

                         BRODY
             I CAN'T WORK IN A VACUUM. WHY DON'T
             YOU MAKE HENDRICKS CHIEF? HIS FAMILY'S
             BEEN HERE SINCE THE PURITANS -- HALF
             THIS ISLAND ARE HIS COUSINS.

                         VAUGHN
             MARTIN, WE HIRED THE BEST MAN WE
             COULD FIND.

   ALL AD LIB AGREEMENT.

                         VAUGHN
             WE NEED SOMEONE WHO ISN'T PREJUDICED
             BY OLD FEUDS OR FAMILY TIES, SOMEONE
             WHO CAN REFEREE THINGS.

                         MEADOWS
             YOU HAVE OUR COMPLETE SUPPORT.

                         VAUGHN
             NOW THEN. WE'VE GOT A VANDALISM
             PROBLEM WE OUGHT TO TALK ABOUT...

   THE OTHERS SURROUND BRODY AS VAUGHN LEADS THE WAY BACK TO
   THE CARS, AD LIBBING THEIR PROBLEM WITH THE LITTLE KARATE
   CHOPPERS.

   HENDRICKS PUTS THE SIGNS BACK INTO THE TRUNK OF VAUGHN'S
   CADILLAC. VAUGHN WAVES CASUALLY TO THE SCOUTS AND SWIMMERS
   WHO ARE VIGOROUSLY TOWELING OFF IN THE BACKGROUND.

   EXT. AMITY STREET - DAY

   IN FRONT OF AMITY'S ONLY MUSIC STORE, A BATTERED OLD PICK-UP
   TRUCK PULLS IN TO THE CURB. QUINT AND HIS MATE CROSS SILENTLY
   HEADING INTO THE MUSIC STORE.

   INT. AMITY MUSIC STORE - DAY

   A GENTLY TINKLING BELL TOLLS QUINT'S ENTRANCE. INSIDE THE
   STORE, A TEN-YEAR-OLD BOY IS BEING SHOWN A CLARINET. HE IS
   PLAYING A MELLOW LOW TONE, AND RUNNING "ODE TO JOY." QUINT
   LOOMS PAST HIM LIKE NEPTUNE RISING FROM THE DEEP, AND LETS
   HIS HAND DROP ON THE COUNTER WITH A SLAP THAT SOUNDS LIKE A
   CLUB ON FLESH. THE SHOPKEEPER ABANDONS THE LITTLE BOY AND
   MEETS QUINT.

                         SHOPKEEPER
             HELLO, MR. QUINT.

                         QUINT
             FOUR SPOOLS OF NUMBER 12 PIANO WIRE,
             OKAY? I ORDERED THEM.

                         SHOPKEEPER
                  (FINDING THEM UNDER
                  THE COUNTER)
             YESSIR, RIGHT HERE. WHAT DO THOSE
             FISH DO, EAT THIS STUFF?

                         QUINT
             THEY CHOKE ON IT.

   WITHOUT WAITING FOR IT TO BE WRAPPED, HE PICKS UP THE GLEAMING
   WIRE IN HIS GNARLED FIST, AND DROPS A BILL ON THE COUNTER.

                         SHOPKEEPER
             BYE NOW.

   NO ANSWER FROM QUINT, WHO STOPS AND SINGS ALONG WITH THE
   BOY.

   THE LITTLE KID'S MUSIC DEGENERATES INTO A SERIES OF AWKWARD
   SQUEAKS AND BLURPS, AS QUINT STARES AT HIM. QUINT CONTINUES
   OUT THE DOOR, THREADING HIS WAY THROUGH THE PEOPLE IN THE
   STREET LIKE SOME GREAT FISH. AS HE GETS UP INTO THE CAB OF
   HIS PICK-UP, ITS DOOR SWINGS OPEN SO WE CAN SEE A CRUDE
   STYLIZED SHARK DECORATING ITS SIDE. IT SLAMS BEHIND HIM AS
   QUINT GETS IN AND DRIVES AWAY.

   EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY

   A PLUMP JELLY-BOWL OF A WOMAN PLUNGES INTO THE OCEAN. THERE'S
   ENOUGH THERE TO SATISFY THE MOST GLUTTONOUS SHARK. BUOYANT,
   JOYFUL, SHE SPLASHES AWAY IN ABANDON. FROM HER, WE PAN OFF
   TO REVEAL OTHER CHEERFUL BATHERS ENJOYING THAT LAST
   UNCLUTTERED WEEKEND BEFORE THE SEASON STARTS IN EARNEST.

   ANGLE ON THE WATERLINE

   A MAN AND HIS DOG ARE ROMPING AT THE WATER'S EDGE. THE MAN
   IS THROWING A STICK OUT INTO THE SURF, THE DOG, A HAPPY
   RETRIEVER, IS BOUNDING INTO THE WAVES AFTER IT.

   TWO YOUNG PEOPLE ON THE BEACH

   A GIRL AND HER BOYFRIEND LEAVE THEIR BLANKET AND RUN FOR THE
   WATER, PLAYING TAG, CHASING EACH OTHER, HAVING A WONDERFUL
   TIME.

   ANGLE ON BIRTHDAY PARTY ON THE SAND - MARTIN AND ELLEN BRODY

   HE IS SITTING STIFFLY IN A BEACH CHAIR, SCANNING THE BEACH
   WITH CAREFUL, CAUTIOUS LOOKS, EYEBALLING EVERYTHING THAT'S
   GOING ON.

   AROUND THEIR PARTICULAR BLANKET AND UMBRELLA ARE A NUMBER OF
   ADULTS AND THEIR KIDS, THE YOUNGSTERS GATHERED TO CELEBRATE
   MICHAEL'S BIRTHDAY. ELLEN IS DISHING OUT ICE CREAM AND CAKE
   FROM A COOLER CHEST TO THE RAUCOUS 10-YEAR-OLDS. MICHAEL'S
   HAND IS STILL BANDAGED.

                         MAX TAFT
                  (AN ADULT)
             LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER BIG SEASON. GETS
             WORSE EVERY YEAR.

                         MRS. TAFT
             AND NONE OF THEM FROM THE ISLAND.
             JUST A LOT OF BOTHER.

   BRODY (AND WE) HEAR A SHRILL SCREAM FROM THE WATER. HE
   STRETCHES TO LOOK PAST THE GROUP, TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING
   OUT THERE.

   BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - THE WATER

   THE YOUNG LADY IS DISAPPEARING UNDER THE WATER, PULLED UNDER
   THE WAVES BY SOME FORCE. SHE IS SHRIEKING. SHE POPS RIGHT UP
   AGAIN RIDING THE SHOULDERS OF HER BOYFRIEND, WHO PULLED HER
   UNDER. SHE'S LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY. BRODY IS UNAMUSED.

   THE ADULTS

                         BRODY
                  (TO TAFT)
             WHAT?

                         TAFT
             PRESENT COMPANY EXCEPTED, BUT OFF-
             ISLANDERS ARE A PAIN IN THE BUTT.
             PARDON MY FRENCH.

   ELLEN CAPTURES SEAN, AND HOLDS HIM PLAYFULLY, AN EXAMPLE.

                         ELLEN
             WHAT ABOUT THIS KID? WHAT IF HE WERE
             BORN HERE. THAT MAKE HIM AN ISLANDER?

                         TAFT
             JUST 'CAUSE A CAT HAS KITTENS IN AN
             OVEN, IT DON'T MAKE THEM MUFFINS.

                         SEAN
             I'M NOT A MUFFIN! I'M A BOY!

   BRODY RUMPLES HIS HAIR AND SETS HIM OFF TO PLAY.

   ANGLE ON ANOTHER SMALL BOY, PLAYING ALONE

   IT'S ALEX KINTNER, AND HIS MOTHER, NEARBY, READING A NOVEL.

   ALEX IS TOWING A FUNNY RUBBER RAFT, AND HEADED FOR THE WATER.

                         MRS. KINTNER
             ALEX! ALEX KINTNER! WHERE DO YOU
             THINK YOU'RE GOING?

                         ALEX
             WATER. JUST ONCE MORE, PLEASE?

                         MRS. KINTNER
             LET ME SEE YOUR FINGERS --

   HE HOLDS OUT HIS HANDS.

                         MRS. KINTNER
             THEY'RE BEGINNING TO PRUNE. 10 MINUTES
             MORE.

   ALEX STARTS FOR THE OCEAN. BEHIND HIM, MICHAEL AND HIS GANG
   ARE ALSO HEADING FOR THE INVITING WAVES. BRODY IS WATCHING
   THEM GO, HIS SPINE RIGID WITH TENSION.

   MAN AND HIS DOG

   AS ALEX AND THE BOYS HIT THE WATER, WE SEE THE MAN THROWING
   HIS STICK INTO THE WAVES, HIS DOG SWIMMING STRONGLY AFTER
   IT.

   BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

   OUT BEYOND THE KIDS AND THE DOG, THE FAT LADY IS BOBBING
   AROUND, OUT WAY TOO FAR, ISOLATED FROM THE OTHER SWIMMERS.

   UNDERWATER VIEW - EXT. - DAY

   A FISH'S-EYE VIEW OF THE BATHERS: LOTS OF LITTLE KICKING
   LEGS, RAFTS WITH TASTY ARMS DANGLING IN THE BLUE, SLOWING
   CIRCLING, FAVORING ONE RAFT (LITTLE ALEX'S). THE KINTNER
   BOY'S LEGS AND ARMS ARE KICKING AND PADDLING, PRODUCING
   BIZARRE UNDERWATER VIBRATIONS OF MORE THAN PASSING INTEREST.
   DOG GOES BY, DOG-PADDLING ALONG.

   ON THE BEACH

   BRODY IS HALF-RISING, LOOKING OUT OVER THE WATER. THE FAT
   LADY IS NOT WHERE HE REMEMBERED HER. HE SCANS THE WATER
   ANXIOUSLY.

                         ELLEN
             DO YOU WANT THE BOYS TO COME IN?
             HONEY, IF YOU'RE WORRIED...

   A BLACK OBJECT SWIMS ACROSS THE WATER. IT'S THE DOG, BREASTING
   AGAINST THE SURF.

   ANGLE ON THE WATER - BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

   IT'S THE FAT LADY, FLOATING, RELAXING. A BLACK OBJECT SWIMS
   UP TO HER. IT'S NOT THE DOG. IT REARS UP OUT OF THE WATER.

   IT'S A MAN IN A BLACK BATHING CAP. THEY EXCHANGE DISTANT
   PLEASANTRIES, HE STROKES AWAY.

   ANOTHER ANGLE - WATER

   ALEX KINTNER, PADDLING AROUND, MAKING BOAT SOUNDS, TOOTING,
   GOING "VROOM, VROOM."

   ANGLE ON THE BOY AND GIRL

   THEY KISS, EMBRACE, KISS AGAIN. STRONG STUFF. THEY SINK
   BENEATH THE WAVES, KNOTTED IN AN EMBRACE.

   ANGLE ON MICHAEL BRODY AND HIS FRIENDS

   HE'S TRYING TO SALVAGE A SOGGY PIECE OF BIRTHDAY CAKE, HOLDING
   IT ABOVE THE WATER, PADDLING WITH HIS OTHER HAND. THE BANDAGE
   HAS COME PART WAY LOOSE, AND HIS CUT IS TRAILING IN THE WATER.

   BRODY AND ELLEN ON THE BEACH

   ELLEN IS RUBBING SUNTAN OIL ON HIS BACK, AND HE IS ALLOWING
   HIMSELF TO RELAX PART WAY. HIS EYES STILL NERVOUSLY SCAN THE
   BEACH IN A CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE. MR. KEISEL IS COMING OUT
   OF THE WATER, TOWELING OFF VIGOROUSLY, EXCLAIMING TO HIMSELF.

                         BRODY
                  (TO KEISEL)
             HOW'S THE WATER?

                         KEISEL
             TOO COLD. I'M GOING IN AGAIN LABOR
             DAY. HOPE WE GET THIS WEATHER NEXT
             WEEKEND.

                         ELLEN
             YOU'RE VERY TIGHT, Y'KNOW?
                  (DIGS IN)
             RIGHT THERE.

                         BRODY
             OW.
                  (HE SEES SOMETHING)
             HE'S GOTTA BE MORE CAREFUL IN THE
             WATER...

   ANGLE ON THE GANG PLAYING IN THE WATER

   MICHAEL HAS JUST BEEN DRENCHED. HE SPLASHES BACK. A BIG
   WATERFIGHT ENSUES, THE BOYS SPLASHING AND CHOPPING AT THE
   WATER, SHOUTING BATTLE CRIES AND KARATE WHOOPS. ALEX IS
   PADDLING AROUND NEAR THEM, BUT NOT INVOLVED WITH THEM.

   ALONG THE WATERLINE ON THE BEACH

   THE MAN WITH THE DOG IS WHISTLING INTO THE OCEAN, LOOKING
   FOR HIS DOG.

                         DOG MAN
             BUSTER! HEY, BUSTER! HERE BOY!
                  (WHISTLES)
             HE CONTINUES TO AD LIB CALLING HIS
             DOG, BUT THERE'S NO ANSWER, NO DOG
             IN THE WATER.

   THE WATERFRONT

   A HUGE SPLASH EXPLODES IN THE WATER NEAR THE GANG, AN ERUPTION
   OF FOAM AND SPRAY THAT STOPS EVERYONE COLD FOR A MOMENT.
   THEY STOP TO SEE WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE.

                         A KID (MATHEW)
             HEY, NO FAIR SPLASHING IN THE EYES!

   BEFORE ANYONE CAN ANSWER, ANOTHER KID (P.J.) RENEWS THE
   BATTLE, WHOOPING A KARATE CRY, AND SLASHING AT THE WATER
   WITH HIS HAND LIKE A LITTLE KUNG-FU WARRIOR, ADVANCING THROUGH
   THE WAVES.

   CLOSE ON MATHEW, SPLASHING BACK

   HE HITS THE WATER, WHICH SPRAYS UP SUSPICIOUSLY PINK. HE
   STARES AT IT, SURPRISED.

   CLOSE ON P.J.

   HIS HANDS ARE DRIPPING DEEP PINK, THE RED MATTING HIS HAIR,
   RUNNING INTO HIS EYES. HE LOOKS DOWN. THE BOYS ARE SURROUNDED
   WITH A DEEP PINK SLICK, THEIR LITTLE BODIES RINGED BY A
   SPREADING STAIN OF BLOOD.

   ANGLE ON SHORE, A TOURIST AND HIS WIFE

   HE'S POINTING FRANTICALLY OUT TO SEA.

                         TOURIST
             SOMETHING IN THE WATER. RIGHT THERE!
             DIDN'T ANYONE SEE IT?

                         WOMAN
             THERE'S BLOOD IN THE WATER.

   ANGLE ON BRODY

   HE LEAPS TO HIS FEET, NEARLY KNOCKING ELLEN OVER, AND STARTS
   FOR THE WATER.

                         ELLEN
             WHAT IS IT...?

   BRODY IS PELTING TOWARDS THE WATER. HE KICKS SAND OVER AN
   ANNOYED MRS. KINTNER, WHO LOOKS UP, JUST IN TIME TO HEAR
   BRODY'S BELLOW.

                         BRODY
             MICHAEL! SEAN! OUT OF THE WATER.
             EVERYBODY OUT OF THE WATER! MICHAEL!
             GET OUT!

   HIS URGENCY COMMUNICATES ITSELF TO THE OTHERS. ELLEN SNATCHES
   SEAN UP FROM WHERE HE'S BEEN PLAYING IN THE SAND. OTHER
   PARENTS ARE CALLING THEIR KIDS, HYSTERIA MOUNTING. PEOPLE
   RUSH INTO THE WATER, DRAGGING THEIR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES
   BODILY OUT OF THE OCEAN. THE FIRST KIDS COMING OUT OF THE
   SURF ARE FRANTICALLY TRYING TO WASH THE STICKY BLOOD OFF
   THEIR BODIES. THE SIGHT OF THE RED SENDS THE BEACH INTO A
   FULL PANIC.

   CLOSE ON BRODY

   HE RUSHES INTO THE WATER, UP TO HIS ANKLES, AND SUDDENLY
   STOPS, UNABLE TO MOVE INTO DEEPER WATER. HE IS URGING MICHAEL
   OUT, HOLDING HIS HANDS OUT TO HIS SON, WHO IS SLOGGING THROUGH
   THE SURF TOWARDS HIS DAD. HE STANDS THERE IMMOBILIZED BY THE
   WATER, NERVOUSLY HELPING PEOPLE OUT OF IT ONTO THE BEACH.

   ANGLE ON MICHAEL

   AS HE EMERGES FROM THE WATER, ALEX KINTNER'S RAFT WASHES IN
   BEHIND HIM, RIPPED IN HALF, THE WATER PINK, THE FOAM SPREADING
   THE STAIN ONTO THE SAND AS THE WAVE BREAKS.

   ANGLE ON MRS. KINTNER

   HER VOICE RISING INTO PANIC AND HYSTERIA WITH EACH UNANSWERED
   CRY.

                         MRS. KINTNER
             ALEX! ALEX? ALEX...!

   EXT - THE COUNTY COURTHOUSE AND COUNTY OFFICES - DAY

   WE ARE LOOKING AT THE CLOSED DOUBLE WHITE FRONT DOORS OF THE
   BUILDING, THROUGH WHICH WE CAN HEAR A ROLLING BOIL OF AGITATED
   CONVERSATION. AFTER A BEAT, THEY OPEN TO REVEAL MRS. KINTNER,
   LOOKING AS THOUGH SHE HAS BEEN VISITED BY THE WRATH OF GOD;
   IN EFFECT, SHE HAS. HER EYES ARE PUFFY AND SWOLLEN FROM
   WEEPING, HER CLOTHING IS PUT ON AND FASTENED AWKWARDLY, HER
   GAIT IS NOT NORMAL. AS SHE WALKS TOWARD US, QUINT ENTERS
   WITH HIS BACK TO US, THEY PASS WITHOUT NOTICE; MRS. KINTNER
   MOVING OUT OF SIGHT, QUINT LEADING US THROUGH THE DOORS INTO
   THE TOWN HALL.

   INT. COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

   A CROWD OF ANGRY MEN AND WOMEN THRONG THE CENTRAL HALLWAY,
   THEIR VOICES A BABBLE OF CONFUSION. MANY OF THEM ARE GATHERED
   AROUND A ROUGHLY LETTERED NOTICE THAT HAS BEEN POSTED ON THE
   TOWN'S OFFICIAL BULLETIN BOARD. IT READS.

   "A $3000 BOUNTY TO THE MAN OR MEN WHO CATCH AND KILL THE
   SHARK THAT KILLED ALEX M. KINTNER ON SUNDAY, JUNE 29, ON THE
   AMITY TOWN BEACH."

   VAUGHN AND BRODY ARE ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE CROWD, WHICH
   INCLUDES MEADOWS, SOME SELECTMEN, AND OTHERS.

                         BRODY
             LOOK, I'VE GOT TO TALK TO HER. THIS
             ISN'T A CONTEST WE WANT THE WHOLE
             COUNTRY ENTERING.

                         MEADOWS
             I AGREE. IF SHE'S GOING TO ADVERTISE,
             I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND OUT-OF-TOWN
             PAPERS. AMITY PEOPLE COULD TAKE CARE
             OF THIS.

                         BRODY
             I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY
             AROUND HERE...

                         VAUGHN
             THEN GO OUT TOMORROW AND MAKE SURE
             NO ONE GETS HURT.
                  (ADDRESSING THE CROWD)
             EVERYBODY, COULD I HAVE YOUR
             ATTENTION? SINCE THIS AFFECTS ALL OF
             US, I SUGGEST WE MOVE INTO COUNCIL
             CHAMBERS, WHERE THERE'S MORE ROOM...

   THERE IS A FLURRY AND A BUSTLE AS EVERYONE REARRANGES
   THEMSELVES AND MAKES THEIR WAY INTO THE AMITY SELECTMEN'S
   COUNCIL CHAMBERS.

   INT. COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY

   THE CROWD IS THRONGING INTO THE LARGE ROOM. ALREADY IN THE
   ROOM IS A SOLITARY FIGURE, STANDING ALL THE WAY IN THE REAR,
   WATCHING EVERYONE AS THEY ENTER. AGAINST THE BACK WALL IS A
   LARGE BLACKBOARD USED FOR TOWN BUSINESS DURING MEETINGS.

                         VAUGHN
             WELL, HERE WE ALL ARE; ANYONE HAVE
             ANY SPECIAL QUESTIONS?

                         DENHERDER
             IS THAT $3000 BOUNTY ON THE SHARK IN
             CASH OR CHECK?
                  (LAUGHTER FROM ALL)

                         VAUGHN
             THAT'S PRIVATE BUSINESS BETWEEN YOU
             BRAVE FISHERMEN AND MRS. KINTNER.
                  (TO BRODY)
             -- CHIEF --

                         BRODY
                  (STEPPING IN)
             I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU WHAT WE'RE DOING
             SO FAR. THESE ARE SOME OF THE STEPS
             I'VE TAKEN AS CHIEF OF POLICE...

                         MEADOWS
                  (LEADING THE DIRECTION
                  OF THE DISCUSSION)
             WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THE BEACHES,
             CHIEF?

   ALL REACT.

                         BRODY
             I'LL GET TO THAT IN A MINUTE. FIRST,
             I PLAN TO START OUR SEASONAL SUMMER
             HELP EARLY, AND TO USE SHARK SPOTTERS
             ON BEACHES OPEN TO THE SEA. I'D LIKE
             COOPERATION FROM LOCAL FISHERMEN,
             AND I'VE ALSO CONTACTED THE
             OCEANOGRAPHIC INSTITUTE OVER ON THE
             MAINLAND.

                         VAUGHN
                  (INTERRUPTING -- SOTTO
                  VOICE TO BRODY)
             NO NEED TO INVOLVE OUTSIDERS IN OUR
             BUSINESS, MARTIN.

                         WOMAN
             ARE YOU GOING TO CLOSE THE BEACHES?

                         BRODY
             LARRY AND I HAVE ALSO DECIDED TO
             CLOSE THE BEACHES FOR A SHORT TIME.

   PANDEMONIUM. A COLLECTIVE NERVE HAS BEEN TOUCHED.

                         VAUGHN
             ONLY 24 HOURS!

                         BRODY
             I DIDN'T AGREE TO THAT!

                         MRS. TAFT
             THAT OFFICIAL BUSINESS COULD TAKE
             ALL SUMMER!

                         MR. KEISEL
             MAYBE IT'S BETTER TO CLOSE.

   TWO OPINIONS HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED, AND THE CROWD TAKES SIDES
   VOCIFEROUSLY, AD LIBBING ASSENT OR DISSENT DEPENDING ON THE
   POINT OF VIEW HELD FORTH.

         THOSE IN FAVOR

             MR. WISEMAN
     WE SHOULD MAKE SURE
     THERE IS NO DANGER.

             MR. HASSETT
     I DIDN'T RAISE MY KIDS TO BE SOME
     FISH'S LUNCH!

                                           THOSE OPPOSED

                                           MRS. TAFT
                                   THE MOTEL IS ALL I OWN --
                                   YOU PULL THE PLUG ON THIS
                                   TOWN AND I GO DOWN THE
                                   DRAIN WITH IT.

                                           MR. POSNER
                                   NOBODY'S SEEN A SHARK.

                                           MR. POLK
                                   WE'LL LOSE BUSINESS, WE
                                   LOSE TAXES, WE LOSE OUR
                                   SHIRTS!

   ANGLE ON QUINT, THE MAN IN THE BACK OF THE ROOM

   HE HAS JUST RUN HIS LARGE, COARSE FINGERNAILS OVER THE
   BLACKBOARD. HE IS A LARGE, ROUGH MAN, A PROFESSIONAL FISHERMAN
   MARKED BY DAILY PHYSICAL TOIL, ABOUT 45 OR 50, IT'S HARD TO
   TELL WHERE THE SCARS LEAVE OFF AND THE WRINKLES BEGIN. THERE
   IS A BIT OF THE SHOWMAN IN HIM, AS WELL AS A BIT OF KILLER-
   WHALE.

                         QUINT
                  (AFTER TAKING A DEEP
                  BREATH)
             YOU ALL KNOW ME. YOU KNOW WHAT I DO
             FOR A LIVING. I'LL GO OUT AND GET
             THIS BIRD FOR YOU. HE'S A BAD ONE
             AND IT'S NOT LIKE GOIN' DOWN THE
             POND CHASING BLUE-GILLS AND TOMMY-
             CODS. THIS IS A FISH THAT CAN SWALLOW
             A MAN WHOLE. A LITTLE SHAKIN', A
             LITTLE TENDERIZING AND DOWN YA' GO.
                  (A LOOK TO VAUGHN)
             YOU GOTTA GET THIS FELLOW AND GET
             HIM QUICK. IF YOU DO, IT'LL BRING A
             LOT OF TOURIST BUSINESS JUST TO SEE
             HIM AND YOU'VE GOT YOUR BUSINESS
             BACK ON A PAYING BASIS.
                  (BEAT)
             A SHARK OF THAT SIZE IS NO PLEASURE
             AND I VALUE MY NECK AT A HELL OF A
             LOT MORE'N 3,000 BUCKS.
                  (A DEADLY LOOK)
             I'LL FIND HIM FOR THREE. BUT I'LL
             KILL HIM FOR TEN.

   CROWD REACTION.

                         QUINT
                  (HE RISES UP)
             THE BASTARD IS COSTING YOU MORE'N
             THAT EVERY DAY. DO YOU WANNA STAY
             ALIVE AND ANNEE UP THE TEN OR PLAY
             IT CHEAP AND BE ON WELFARE NEXT
             WINTER.
                  (A FINAL MOMENT)
             I'M GONNA KILL THIS THING... JUST A
             MATTER OF WHETHER I DO IT NOW -- OR
             AT THE END OF SUMMER.

                         VAUGHN
             THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MR. QUINT, THE
             SELECTMEN WILL TAKE YOUR OFFER UNDER
             ADVISEMENT

   INT. BRODY'S STUDY AT HOME - SUNSET

   A RIFFLY BLUR, COLOR ALTERNATING WITH BLACK AND WHITE. THE
   DIZZINESS STOPS ON A BOOK PAGE SHOWING A BLACK AND WHITE
   RENDERING OF EIGHT SPECIES OF SHARK. THE BANNER AT THE TOP
   OF THE PAGE READS: THE KNOWN AND REPUTED MANEATERS.

   THE RIFFLING BEGINS AGAIN, STOPS ON A GRIZZLY PHOTOGRAPH OF
   SCAR TISSUE ON SIX FORMER SHARK VICTIMS. RIFFLING -- STOP.

   PHOTOGRAPH OF FIVE ICHTHYOLOGISTS POSING ON WOODEN STOOLS,
   FRAMED BY THE ENORMOUS JAWS OF A PREHISTORIC SHARK FROM THE
   FAMILY CARCHARODON CHARCHARIAS.

   BRODY

   HIS READING GLASSES REFLECTING A STACK OF TWELVE LIBRARY
   BOOKS, ALL ON THE SUBJECT OF SHARKS AND SHARK ATTACKS. THE
   DOOR OPENS AND ELLEN ENTERS, QUIETLY, IN RESPECT FOR BRODY'S
   MOOD.

                         ELLEN
             CAN YOU STAND SOMETHING TO EAT?

                         BRODY
             LOVE A CUP OF TEA. WITH LEMON.

   ELLEN WALKS PAST BRODY TO THE WINDOW AND LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW
   WHICH OVERLOOKS THE SOUTH BAY. IT IS THE HOUR OF DUSK.

                         ELLEN
             MIKEY LOVES HIS BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

                         BRODY
             WHERE IS HE?

                         ELLEN
                  (WITH A SLIGHT LAUGH)
             HE'S SITTING IN IT.

   BRODY GETS UP, CONCERNED, AND JOINS HER AT THE WINDOW.

                         ELLEN
             HONEY. HE HAS IT TIED UP TO THE JETTY
             WITH A DOUBLE-KNOT.

   BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW

   MICHAEL IS SITTING IN THE BOAT, BUT TWO OF HIS YOUNG SCHOOL
   CHUMS ARE IN THE WATER, SWIMMING AROUND IT. BRODY OPENS THE
   WINDOW AND CALLS DOWN:

                         BRODY
             SON! -- OUT OF THE WATER NOW!

                         MICHAEL
             MY BOAT'S NEAT, DAD!

                         BRODY
                  (TURNING TO ELLEN)
             I WANT HIM OUT OF THE OCEAN.

                         ELLEN
             IT'S THREE FEET DEEP, MARTIN

                         BRODY
                  (ANGRY NOW)
             MICHAEL! COME INSIDE!

                         ELLEN
             IT'S HIS BIRTHDAY PRESENT, AND YOU
             CLOSED THE BEACH, HONEY. I TOLD HIM
             NOT TO GO IN THE WATER AFTER WHAT
             HAPPENED YESTERDAY. I DON'T BELIEVE
             HE'LL EVER DO IT AGAIN.

                         BRODY
             I TOLD HIM NOT TO GO OUT UNTIL HE
             MEMORIZED THE HANDBOOK AND THE SAFETY
             SAFETY REGULATIONS, UNTIL HE WAS
             SURE OF HIMSELF...

   ELLEN'S EYES DRIFT DOWN TO THE OPEN BOOK, WHICH IS DISPLAYING
   A REPRODUCTION OF THE FAMOUS PAINTING "THE GULF STREAM,"
   SHOWING A BLACK FISHERMAN IN A SMALL DINGHY SIMILAR TO
   MICHAEL'S BEING ASSAULTED BY THE JAWS OF THREE MAN-EATING
   SHARKS, CIRCLING HIS BOAT.

                         ELLEN
             YOU HEARD YOUR FATHER! OUT RIGHT
             NOW!

   SUNSET ON THE BEACH

   HENDRICKS AND ANOTHER DEPUTY ARE ASSISTING BRODY. SILHOUETTES
   OF TOWNSPEOPLE LOOK ON LIKE MOURNERS AT A FUNERAL.

   IN THE BACKGROUND SOME WORKMEN ARE TAKING DOWN THE SHUTTERS
   FROM A QUAINT SUMMER COTTAGE. THEY PAUSE TO WATCH THE
   DECLINING MOMENTS OF THE DAY.

   THREE SELECTMEN ALSO STAND WATCHING. ONE OF THEM SEEMS TO BE
   WHISPERING BOUNTY NEWS TO THREE YOUNGISH MEN ON A NEARBY
   DUNE.

   SOUNDS: SURF AND HAMMERING.

                                                        CUT TO:

   EXT. OCEAN AND PIER - NIGHT

   SELECTMAN DENHERDER AND HIS BUDDY, CHARLIE, A PROFESSIONAL
   ANGLER, ROW TOWARDS A TUMBLE-DOWN JETTY THAT LEADS FIFTY
   FEET OUT INTO THE BLACK WATER.

                         DENHERDER
             YOU WANNA CALL IT A NIGHT AFTER HERE?

                         CHARLIE
             IT'S ONLY TWO-THIRTY. WHAT, ARE YOU
             TIRED?

                         DENHERDER
             YEAH, CHARLIE, I GOT MY SECOND WIND
             THREE NIBBLES BACK.

   DENHERDER HEFTS A BLOODSTAINED LAUNDRY BAG FROM THE
   WHEELBARROW, REVEALING ABOUT A HUNDRED FEET OF COILED DOG
   CHAIN AND A LARGE PATCHED INNER TUBE. CHARLIE TAKES OUT A
   MONSTER HOOK AND TOGETHER THEY PUSH THE WHEELBARROW ONTO THE
   RICKETY PIER THAT IS ONLY ABOUT FIVE FEET ACROSS.

                         DENHERDER
                  (REACHING INTO THE
                  BAG)
             LEG OF LAMB THIS TIME?

                         CHARLIE
             SCREW LAMB -- LET'S SHOOT THE SIRLOIN!

                         DENHERDER
                  (A HYENA LAUGH)
             WE'RE BLOWIN' HALF THE BOUNTY ON
             BAIT --

   THE SPLINTERED PIER SWAYS TO AND FRO AS THE MEN REACH THE
   END AND START TO WORK. CHARLIE BAITS THE HOOK WITH A MASSIVE
   CHUNK OF SIRLOIN WHILE DENHERDER SECURES THE LOOSE END OF
   CHAIN TO A SKINNY PILING. CHARLIE THEN FASTENS THE INNER
   TUBE TO THE CHAIN FIVE FEET FROM THE END OF THE HOOK.

                         DENHERDER
             ONE MORE AFTER THIS, THEN I'M GOING
             HOME.

                         CHARLIE
             SET?

   DENHERDER TUGS THE CHAIN AGAINST THE PILING TO PROVE THAT IT
   IS. CHARLIE HEAVES THE BAIT. SPLASH! THE INNER TUBE FOLLOWS
   AND BOTH MEN EAGERLY WATCH AS IT FLOATS SEAWARD, THE CHAIN
   PLAYING OUT FROM THE WHEELBARROW.

                         CHARLIE
             TIDE'S TAKING IT RIGHT OUT.

   CHARLIE LIGHTS HIS PIPE AND SITS BACK AGAINST A PILING. HE
   TURNS ON HIS TRANSISTOR RADIO AND LOOPS ONE END AROUND A
   FRACTURED BOARD. DENHERDER PACES, BORED TO DEATH.

                         DENHERDER
             YOU DO THIS ALL THE TIME, RIGHT,
             CHARLIE?

                         CHARLIE
             TWENTY YEARS.

                         DENHERDER
             I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE PAY MONEY
             TO GO FISHING. THIS IS REALLY DUMB.
             THIS ISN'T EVEN RELAXING... IT'S
             JUST BORING.

   CLOSE - CHAIN IN WHEELBARROW

   SUDDENLY ZIPPING OUT, FASTER AND FASTER, AS BOTH MEN
   STRAIGHTEN.

   DENHERDER IS GOGGLE-EYED.

                         DENHERDER
             HEY! WHAT'S THIS?

   THE CHAIN IS COMING OUT SO FAST THAT IT BEGINS TO DRAG THE
   WHEELBARROW TO THE END OF THE JETTY. A SECTION OF CHAIN
   TANGLES AROUND THE HANDLE AND FLIPS THE ENTIRE MACHINE INTO
   THE AIR. BOTH MEN WATCH DUMBFOUNDED AS THE INNER TUBE, RACING
   OUT TO SEA IN A WAKE OF WHITE WATER, SUDDENLY DIPS UNDER.

                         CHARLIE
             LOOK AT HIM TAKE IT!

                         DENHERDER
             DO I SET THE GODDAM HOOK?

                         CHARLIE
             LET HIM DO IT! GO-GO-GO-GO-GO!

   IT IS THEN THAT THE CHAIN WHIPS TAUT AGAINST THE NARROW
   PILINGS.

   CLOSE - PILING

   A LINEUP OF FIVE DECREPIT 2 X 4 INCH PILINGS SNAP WITH A
   RESOUNDING CRACK.

   ANGLE - JETTY

   THE END OF THE JETTY IS YANKED LOOSE. DENHERDER IS FLIPPED
   LIKE A CHIP OVER THE SIDE AND INTO THE COLD NIGHT WATER,
   WHERE HE MANAGES TO SNAG HOLD OF A SPLINTERED TIMBER.

   DENHERDER'S POINT OF VIEW

   THE SEVERED SECTION OF JETTY, A JOINED PLATFORM OF FOOTBOARDS,
   IS BEING DRAGGED SEAWARD WITH CHARLIE SITTING DAZED ON TOP
   OF IT, HIS LIT PIPE STILL GOING.

                         DENHERDER
             CHARLIE! JUMP!

   CHARLIE ROLLS INTO THE WATER, SPUTTERS, TURNS TO WATCH THE
   FLOTILLA OF WOOD DRAW AWAY.

   CLOSE - CHARLIE

   LOOKING SEAWARD.

   CHARLIE'S POINT OF VIEW

   THE END OF THE JETTY MAKES A 180-DEGREE TURN AND HEADS BACK
   IN HIS DIRECTION.

                         CHARLIE
             HOLY JESUS CHRIST!

   DENHERDER STEPS UP ON THE BROKEN-OFF PILING JUST TO BE OUT
   OF THE WATER.

                         DENHERDER
             GET THE HELL OUT! CHARLIE! SWIM!

   CHARLIE, INHALING TERROR, TRYING TO SLOG TO SHORE. THE JETTY
   IS GETTING CLOSER. SUDDENLY, AN ENORMOUS BLACK FIN BREAKS
   WATER LIKE A PERISCOPE, MAKING COURSE CORRECTIONS AS IT COMES
   FOR CHARLIE.

   DENHERDER JUMPS FROM PILING TO PILING, ALMOST LOSING HIS
   BALANCE ON HIS WAY TO HELP CHARLIE. CHARLIE HAS REACHED THE
   LAST PYLON TOWARD OPEN SEA, AND HIS HANDS CLAMBER FOR A HOLD.
   BUT --

   INSERT - CHARLIE'S HANDS

   THE ALGAE IS TOO SLIPPERY, AND HIS FINGERS KEEP SLIDING BACK.

   THAT'S WHEN THE FIN BEHIND HIM SEEMS TO REACH UP TO THE SKY
   AND CHARLIE MANAGES, WITH DENHERDER'S DESPERATE HELP, TO
   MAKE IT SAFELY TO SHORE. THE REMAINS OF THE PIER FLOAT BELLY-
   UP IN THE INLET.

   CLOSE ON THE HARBORMASTER OF AMITY - DAY

   HE IS SITTING ON A LITTLE CANVAS FOLDING CHAIR, EATING A
   BOWL OF CHEERIOS WITH MILK AND SUGAR, WATCHING A PANORAMA OF
   INEPTITUDE AND GREED UNFOLD BEFORE HIS OLD SEAMAN'S EYES.

   THE AMITY PIER AREA IS A MINOR MADHOUSE: OUT-OF-STATE CARS
   ELBOW LOCAL VEHICLES FOR PARKING SPACE AT THE FOOT OF THE
   DOCK, AND A PARADE OF BOUNTY-HUNTING TOWNSPEOPLE, ISLANDERS,
   OFF-ISLANDERS, TOURIST, AND OTHERS SHOUT AND PUSH THEIR WAY
   ONTO THE CROWDED PIER, EACH CARRYING SOME BIZARRE OR
   APPROPRIATE TOOL FOR THE REAL OR IMAGINED CAPTURE OF AN
   UNARMED SHARK OF INDETERMINATE SIZE.

   RODS AND REELS, DROP LINES, CROSSBOWS, SLINGSHOTS, HARPOONS,
   SHOTGUNS, RIFLES, NETS AND TRIDENTS; EVERY FISHING SUPPLY
   STORE AND SPORTING GOODS HOUSE WITHIN A HUNDRED MILES HAS
   BEEN CANNIBALIZED TO EQUIP THIS WEIRD ARRAY.

   ANGLE ON BRODY AND HENDRICKS ARRIVING ON THE SCENE

   NOT HAVING ROOM TO BRING THEIR POLICE VEHICLE ANYWHERE NEAR
   THIS MESS, THEY ARE PROCEEDING ON FOOT INTO THE CONFUSION.

                         HENDRICKS
             ...SO THEN DENHERDER AND CHARLIE SAT
             THERE TRYING TO CATCH THEIR BREATH,
             AND FIGURING OUT HOW TO EXPLAIN TO
             CHARLIE'S WIFE WHAT HAPPENED TO HER
             FREEZER FULL OF MEAT.

                         BRODY
             THAT WASN'T FUNNY.

   SOME OF THE LOCALS GREET HENDRICKS WITH OCCASIONAL NODS OF
   RECOGNITION, OR AN AD LIBBED "HI, LENNY," OR "HEY, LENNY."

                         HENDRICKS
             MRS. KINTNER MUST'VE PUT HER AD IN
             FIELD AND STREAM.

                         BRODY
             LOOKS MORE LIKE THE READERS OF THE
             NATIONAL ENQUIRER.

   ANGLE ON BOAT RENTAL - PIER

   AN ARGUMENT IS IN PROGRESS BETWEEN AND OUT-OF-TOWNER AND THE
   BOAT RENTAL MAN.

                         OUT-OF-TOWNER
             YOU'RE CHARGING ME DOUBLE THE USUAL
             RENT! I DIDN'T COME UP HERE ALL THE
             WAY FROM NEW ROCHELLE TO BE GOUGED
             BY SOME YANKEE CRACKER!

                         BOAT RENTAL MAN
             PRICES GO UP JUNE FIRST EVERY YEAR.
             YOU WANT A NICE CHEAP, LEAKY BOAT,
             YOU GO DOWN TO THE HAMPTONS.
                  (HE SEES BRODY)
             RIGHT, CHIEF?

   ANGLE LOOKING OUT TO SEA

   MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE CHANNEL TOWARDS THE DOCK IS A
   SLEEK, EXPENSIVE RUNABOUT WITH THE NAME "FASCINATIN' RHYTHM"
   ON THE STERN. IT'S PROFESSIONALLY HANDLED, AND RUMBLES IN AS
   IT COASTS IN TOWARDS THE DOCK AREA. SOME OTHER BOATS CLEAR
   THE WAY FOR IT, ZIG-ZAGGING IN THE HARBOR, CAUSING AN ANNOYING
   CHOP.

   CLOSE ON BOAT

   MATT HOOPER, A BEARDED, BESPECTACLED YOUNG MAN WITH AN INTENT
   LOOK, IS MANEUVERING THE VESSEL PEERING THROUGH HIS WINDSCREEN
   AT THE RAGTAG COLLECTION OF SEAFARING LOONIES ALL AROUND
   HIM.

   BACK TO DOCKSIDE

   HENDRICKS IS MEDIATING THE ARGUMENT BETWEEN THE TWO MEN, AND
   WE CAN HEAR A PLAINTIVE "BUT LENNY," FROM THE LOCAL AS BRODY
   SEES SOMETHING THAT MAKES HIM MOVE TOWARDS THE OTHER SIDE OF
   THE DOCK. WE SEE HIM CROSS TO A LITTLE BOAT BUILT FOR TWO OR
   THREE THAT IS SETTLING LOW IN THE WATER AS A SEVENTH MAN
   CLIMBS IN WITH HIS GEAR.

                         BRODY
             HEY! YOU KNOW HOW MANY MEN THAT'S
             SUPPOSED TO HOLD?

                         MAN IN BOAT (WALTER)
             WHATEVER'S SAFE, RIGHT?

                         BRODY
             WHAT YOU GOT AIN'T SAFE. YOU TAKE
             SOME GUYS OFF OR YOU DON'T GO OUT.

   BEN GARDNER AND HIS BOAT, FLICKA

   MATT HOOPER IS GLIDING INTO THE DOCKSIDE, AND BEN THROWS HIM
   A LINE TO HELP MAKE FAST AS HE MOORS. IT'S A SMALL ISLAND OF
   COURTESY IN AN OTHERWISE DISCOURTEOUS MOB. HOOPER NODS
   POLITELY AS HE TIES HIS BOAT UP AND STEPS ONTO THE DOCK.

                         HOOPER
             HELLO.

                         GARDNER
             HELLO, BACK.

   HE'S STANDING NEAR WHERE BRODY IS FINISHING AFTER HIS
   ENCOUNTER WITH THE CHUMMERS.

   BRODY APPROACHES BEN GARDNER.

                         BRODY
             YOU GOING OUT TOO, BEN?

                         GARDNER
             MIGHT GIVE IT A TRY. THAT THREE
             THOUSAND BOUNTY BEATS WORKING FOR A
             LIVING.
                  (YELLS TO HIS MATE)
             WE READY?

   THE MATE NODS "YES" AND STARTS TO PREPARE TO GET UNDER WAY.

   BEN AND HIS MATE MOVE AWAY FROM THE DOCK, HEADED TOWARDS THE
   CHANNEL AND THE OPEN SEA LEAVING FELIX AND PRATT TO SCAMPER
   AROUND THE DOCK LOOKING FOR ANOTHER RIDE.

   ANOTHER DOCK AREA, CLOSE BY

   A PARTICULARLY AWKWARD MOMENT BETWEEN A SMALL SAILBOAT AND A
   COUPLE OF POWERBOATS. THE SAILBOAT IS TRYING TO HOIST SAIL
   TO MAKE IT AWAY FROM THE PIER UNDER SAIL, A REAL YACHTSMAN'S
   CONCEIT, SINCE HORNBLOWER HIMSELF PROBABLY COULDN'T NAVIGATE
   THROUGH THIS MESS. BRODY, A LANDLUBBER FOR SURE, IS TRYING
   TO DIRECT TRAFFIC TO UNTANGLE THIS NEW MESS.

                         BRODY
             JUST BACK UP! NO, THE OTHER WAY! CUT
             IT TO YOUR LEFT! YOUR OTHER LEFT!
             THE BIG BOAT, YOUR FRONT END IS OUT
             WAY TOO FAR. LITTLE BOAT, STAY STILL!

   AMIDST ALL THIS, WE CAN HEAR THE ANGRY SHOUTS OF THE ENTANGLED
   CREWS.

                         SKIPPER 1 (THE SAILBOAT)
             DAMMIT, A VESSEL UNDER SAIL HAS THE
             RIGHT OF WAY!

                         SKIPPER 2 (MOTORBOAT)
             YOU SCHMUCK, YOU AIN'T UNDER SAIL,
             YOU'RE GODDAM DRIFTING!

                         HOOPER
                  (STEPPING IN TO HELP)
             AHOY, SAIL! YOU GOT AN OAR? WELL,
             SCULL IT OUT!

                         SAILBOAT SKIPPER
             TELL THAT STINKPOTTER TO BELAY!

                         MOTORBOAT SKIPPER
             TELL THAT RAGSETTER I'M GOING TO
             POKE HIM IN THE SNOOT!

                         HOOPER
             JUST CAST OFF IN TURN AND MAKE FOR
             THE CHANNEL, OK?

                         BRODY
             THANKS.

   BRODY STARTS BACK TOWARDS THE SHORE, HOOPER IS BY HIS SIDE.

                         HOOPER
             EXCUSE ME, I WONDER IF YOU COULD
             TELL ME...

   BEFORE HE CAN FINISH, BRODY SPOTS SOMETHING ON SHORE THAT
   MOVES HIM TO SHOUT TO HIS DEPUTY.

                         HOOPER
                  (NOTICING SOMETHING)
             IS THAT DYNAMITE?

   BRODY LOOKS, AND STOPS BY A BOAT THAT'S ABOUT TO CAST OFF.

   HE HOLDS OUT HIS HAND.

                         BRODY
             IF THAT'S DYNAMITE, GIVE IT HERE, OR
             DON'T LEAVE PORT.

                         MAN
             AW, C'MON, IT'S JUST FIREWORKS. SHARKS
             LIKE FIREWORKS, IT ATTRACTS THEM.

                         BRODY
             HAND IT OVER.

   THE MAN PASSES BRODY A CIGAR BOX FILLED WITH DYNAMITE STICKS.

   BRODY TUCKS THE DYNAMITE UNDER HIS ARM, AND CONTINUES DOWN
   THE PIER. HOOPER IS STILL WITH HIM.

   ALL AROUND THEM ARE TWO DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT BREEDS; THE
   QUIET PROS, LIKE BEN GARDNER, IN WELL-WORN, COMFORTABLE
   CLOTHES, WITH EFFICIENT, SENSIBLE GEAR, AND THE AMATEUR
   CRAZIES, WITH ALL MANNER OF WEAPONS AND IMPRACTICAL, SILLY
   TOURIST CLOTHING.

   INT. DOCK SHED - DAY

   BRODY IS ON THE PHONE, TALKING TO HIS OFFICE, TRYING TO GET
   HENDRICKS' ATTENTION. HE THROWS A HANDFUL OF WASHERS AT THE
   WINDOW.

                         HOOPER
             THERE'S A FANTAIL LAUNCH OUT THERE
             THAT WON'T MAKE IT BEYOND THE
             BREAKWATER.

                         BRODY
             YOU'RE TELLIN' ME. I SWEAR, THIS
             TOWN HAS GONE CRAZY.

                         HOOPER
             OFFICER, I WONDER IF YOU COULD TELL
             ME WHERE I COULD FIND CHIEF BRODY?

                         BRODY
             WHO ARE YOU?

                         HOOPER
             HOOPER, MATT HOOPER. FROM THE
             OCEANOGRAPHIC INSTITUTE.
                  (HOLDS OUT HIS HAND)

   EXTERIOR - OCEAN - DAY

   BEN GARDNER'S BOAT IS IN THE LEAD WITH GARDNER'S SHOUTING
   DERISIVE COMMENTS AT THE CROWD HEADED OUT FROM LAND. THE
   ARMADA IS SPREAD OUT AND MOVING IN A RAGGED CIRCLE, FIFTEEN
   BOATS IN ALL. ONE MAN HEAVES CHERRY BOMBS INTO THE WATER. A
   SMALLER BOAT GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OFFERS US
   BARWOOD, FORKING SPAGHETTI LEFTOVERS INTO THE OCEAN WHILE
   HIS FRIEND POURS OUT A BOTTLE OF KETCHUP.

   A SPEEDBOAT CHUGS BY, ONE OF THE OCCUPANTS READING
   INSTRUCTIONS ALOUD FROM A BOOK ENTITLED "SHARKS - EAST COAST,
   VOL. I."

   BOATLOAD OF IMPOVERISHED SCALLOP FISHERMEN THROW A NET
   OVERBOARD, FULL OF GAPS AND SPLIT ENDS. THE PROFESSIONALS
   LOOK PROFESSIONAL, BUT THE LANDLUBBERS OUT FOR THE $3000
   MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR EVERYBODY. COLLISIONS ARE BARELY
   AVERTED.

   THE RUBE GOLDBERG ERROR

   THE OUT-OF-TOWNER IN A SMALL BOAT IS BENT OVER IN A LIFE AND

   DEATH STRUGGLE, HIS ROD IN A TIGHT ARC. HIS BUDDY LEAPS ACROSS
   TO LEND A HAND.

   TWENTY YARDS AWAY IN ANOTHER BOAT THE SAME STRUGGLE ENSUES.

   THIS TIME IT'S THE OVERLOADED BOAT WITH THE POOR SCALLOP
   FISHERMEN. SHOUTS OF I'M ON! DIG IN! STRIKE! THEN A TANGLE
   OF TACKLE SPRINGS FROM THE WATER. THEY HAVE HOOKED EACH OTHER.

   JOY TURNS TO SWEARING.  ARNOLD FELIX STANDS UP TO APPLAUD
   THE MISHAP, WHILE HIS BUDDY PRATT TAKES CAREFUL AIM WITH HIS
   REMINGTON 1100 12-GAUGE AND BLASTS AT THE TACKLE AS IF IT
   WERE A CLAY PIGEON.  THE TANGLE EXPLODES --

   BOTH THE OUT-OF-TOWNERS AND THE SCALLOP FISHERMAN FALLS OVER
   BACKWARD --

   ANGLE - HARRY'S BOAT

   THREE MEN ARE ABOARD, ONE HOLDING A ROD WHICH HOLDS A FAST
   ARC. A FEW YARDS OFF STERN WE SEE A TRIANGULAR DORSAL FIN
   CROSSING BACK AND FORTH, STRUGGLING, JERKING, THE MIGHTY
   TAIL THRESHING. ONE MAN IS SCREAMING SUCCESS, THE OTHER TWO
   SLAPPING THE ANGLER ON THE BACK.

   CLOSE - PRATT AND FELIX

   THEY SPOT IT AND SOUR.

                         PRATT
             WELL, GET OVER THERE! HE AIN'T CAUGHT
             IT YET!

   THE OWNER OF PRATT'S BOAT THROWS IT FORWARD AND PRATT REMOVES
   A .45 AUTOMATIC FROM THE HOLSTER OF HIS BELT. HE TESTS IT,
   FIRING ONCE IN THE AIR. AS THEY NEAR THE SCENE OF THE
   STRUGGLE, ELEVEN OTHER BOATS BEGIN CONVERGING, UNTIL --

   HARRY'S BOAT

   EVERYONE WANTS TO GET INTO THE ACT. THEY ARE ATTACKING THE

   THRESHING BEAST WITH ALL THEY'VE GOT. PRATT USES HIS
   AUTOMATIC, ANOTHER BLASTS POINT BLANK WITH A SHOTGUN. THERE
   ARE OCCASIONAL WATER RICOCHETS AND THE BOUNTY HUNTERS DUCK
   FROM TIME TO TIME AS BULLETS SKIP BY. FINALLY, THE SHARK
   STOPS THRESHING.

   FELIX AND PRATT

   THEIR BOAT HAS MOVED CLOSE TO THE SHARK, CLOSER THAN HARRY'S.

                         PRATT
                  (EXULTANT)
             HAND ME THAT POLE! QUICK!

   ONE OF HIS PARTY IN THE OVER-FILLED BOAT GRABS A GAFF AND
   LEANS OUT TO GRAB THE MORIBUND SHARK. BUT HARRY WON'T GIVE
   UP THE LINE, STILL REELING IN.

                         HARRY
             BEAT IT! I HOOKED HIM!

                         PRATT
             HOW'S THE FAMILY, HARRY?
                  (TO THE MAN WITH GAFF)
             GO ON AND DO IT!

                         MAN WITH GAFF
             WE SPLIT DOWN THE MIDDLE?

   PRATT NODS RELUCTANTLY. THE MAN SWINGS, LODGES THE GAFF AND
   HAULS THE SHARK UP ONTO THE GUNWALE. A PAROXYSM OF CHEERS
   FROM THE SURROUNDING BOATS. SMOKE FLARES ARE FIRED INTO THE
   AIR.

                         HARRY
                  (A TUG-OF-WAR)
             LET GO MY SHARK!

   IT IS A TEN-FOOT TIGER, AND WHAT A MESS -- SPLATTERED WITH
   BULLET PUNCTURES, GASHES, BLEEDING FROM SEVERAL ORIFICES.
   BUT IT IS NOT DEAD -- IT KICKS BACK TO LIFE AND THREATENS TO
   CAPSIZE THE BOAT. PRATT PANICS AND FIRES SIX TIMES WITH HIS
   .45. THE BULLETS PIERCE THE SHARK'S HEAD, PASS THROUGH, AND
   SPLIT THE FIBERGLASS HULL THROUGH WHICH A FLOOD OF WATER
   RISES. EVERYBODY STANDS UP AS THE BOAT SLIPS BENEATH THEM.

   INT. MORGUE - DAY

   THE AMITY MORGUE IS ALSO THE AMITY FUNERAL HOME, A VICTORIAN
   HOUSE THAT NORMALLY SERVES AS THE COMMUNITY'S MORTUARY. THE
   CORONER, A PROFESSIONAL SMALL-TOWN GP, IS STANDING BY AS
   HOOPER IS SPEAKING INTO A SOPHISTICATED CASSETTE RECORDER
   WITH A HEADPIECE THAT LEAVES HIS HANDS FREE FOR MEASUREMENT
   WITH A CALIBRATOR OR CALIPERS.

                         BRODY
             LET'S SHOW MR. HOOPER OUR ACCIDENT.

   WITH A SHRUG, THE CORONER SLIDES OPEN THE DRAWER.

   CLOSE ON HOOPER

   HE IS LOOKING DOWN AS THE DRAWER SLIDES PAST HIM, STILL MATTER-
   OF-FACT, TURNING ON HIS RECORDER.

                         HOOPER
             VICTIM ONE, IDENTIFIED AS CHRISTINE
             WATKINS, FEMALE CAUCASIAN...

   THE SHEET HAS JUST BEEN LIFTED, AND HOOPER STARES DOWN AT
   THE LUMP ON THE SLAB. HE STOPS, TURNS OFF HIS RECORDER AS
   EMOTIONS WAGE WAR WITH HIS SENSES. RATIONALITY WINS, AND HE
   TURNS ON THE RECORDER AGAIN.

                         BRODY
             NO, WE JUST CHECKED THE BEACH...

                         HOOPER
                  (TURNS OFF THE RECORDER)
             IT WASN'T AN 'ACCIDENT,' IT WASN'T A
             BOAT PROPELLER, OR A CORAL REEF, OR
             JACK THE RIPPER. IT WAS A SHARK. IT
             WAS A SHARK.

   EXT. DOCK AREA - DAY

   WE OPEN CLOSE ON UGLY, OPEN SHARK'S JAWS, STILL OOZING BLOOD
   AND GORE. AS THE SHARK IS HOISTED UP INTO THE AIR ON A GIN-
   POLE HOIST DOCKSIDE, MEADOWS IS SEEN PASSING WITH HIS
   SECRETARY AND A PHOTOGRAPHER FROM THE AMITY GAZETTE. A CROWD
   OF RETURNING FISHERMEN FROM THE ARMADA AND TOWNSPEOPLE ARE
   GATHERING AROUND THE FISH AS IT IS HOISTED TAIL-UP INTO THE
   CLASSIC SPORTS FISHERMAN'S TROPHY SHOT.

                         MEADOWS
             GINNY, GET THIS OUT ON THE STATE
             WIRE TO AP AND UPI IN BOSTON AND NEW
             YORK. HAVE ONE OF THEM PICK IT UP
             FOR THE NATIONAL AND CALL DAVE AXELROD
             IN NEW YORK AND TELL HIM THIS IS
             FROM ME AND HE OWES ME ONE... LET'S
             GET A PICTURE.

   AS HE AND THE PHOTOGRAPHER TURN TO MOB, WE SEE HOOPER AND
   BRODY ARRIVING FROM THE MORGUE. HOOPER IMMEDIATELY HEADS
   TOWARDS THE SHARK, WHILE BRODY PAUSES AND WE SEE A LOOK OF
   RELIEF AND DELIGHT CROSS HIS FEATURES.

                         HOOPER
             WELL, IF ONE MAN CAN CATCH A FISH IN
             50 DAYS, THEN I GUESS 50 OF THESE
             BOZOS CAN CATCH A FISH IN ONE DAY --
             BEGINNER'S LUCK.

                         BRODY
                  (CROSSING TO MEN AROUND
                  SHARK)
             YOU DID IT! DID BEN GARDNER CATCH
             THIS?

   MEN AD LIB "NO, I CAUGHT IT..." "I HOOKED HIM," ETC.

                         MEADOWS
             OKAY, EVERYBODY, I WANT TO GET A
             PICTURE FOR THE PAPER -- COULD
             EVERYONE CLEAR OUT OF THE WAY?

   HE CONTINUES TO CALL DIRECTIONS AND MOVE PEOPLE OUT OF THE
   WAY TO SET UP HIS SHOT. HOOPER IS MEASURING THE SHARK.

                         MEADOWS
             COULD YOU GET OUT OF THE SHOT, YOUNG
             MAN?

                         HOOPER
             WHO, ME? OKAY...
                  (HE DRIFTS OFF)

   THE MEN (FELIX, PRATT, ET AL) GET BRODY TO JOIN THEM IN THE
   SHOT. THE WHOLE TOWN AND THE ARMADA FISHERMEN ALL LINE UP IN
   A CLASSIC "HIGH SCHOOL" GRADUATING CLASS SHOT WITH THE
   VICTORIOUS FISHERMEN KNEELING IN FRONT, AND THE REST OF THE
   ARMADA AND TOWNSPEOPLE ARRANGED BEHIND THEM. HENDRICKS HOLD
   UP THE "BEACH CLOSED" SIGN IN IRONIC VICTORY.

   ANGLE SHOWING VAUGHN APPROACHING THE DOCK

   BRODY SPOTS THE MAYOR COMING TOWARDS THE DOCK, AND DETACHES
   HIMSELF FROM THE GROUP TO JOIN HIM.

                         BRODY
             LARRY, IF YOU'D SEE THESE CLOWNS
             LEAVE, YOU'D NEVER BELIEVE THEY'D
             COME BACK WITH ANYTHING. BUT THEY
             GOT HIM!

                         VAUGHN
             THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S REAL GOOD. BEN
             MEADOWS GETTING PICTURES FOR THE
             PAPER.

                         BRODY
             SURE HE IS.

   HOOPER AND THE FISHERMEN

   THE MEN WHO LANDED THE MONSTER ARE IN A TIGHT CLUSTER,
   DEBATING SOMETHING WITH HOOPER, WHO IS DWARFED BY THE BIG
   BEER BELLIES AND HAM-FISTED HANDS ALL AROUND HIM. IT'S
   PROBABLE WE DON'T EVEN SEE HIM.

   THE MEN AD LIB "WHAT KIND OF SHARK IS THIS?" "IT'S A SHARK
   LIKE IN THE MOVIES THEY GOT SHARKS." "IT'S A MAN-EATER, FOR
   SURE." "I BET IT'S A RECORD-BREAKER," ETC.

                         HOOPER (O.S.)
             IT'S A TIGER SHARK. VERY RARE IN
             THESE WATERS, AND DEFINITELY A
             MANEATER.

   HOOPER ENTERS THE CIRCLE, AND PICKS UP WHERE HE LEFT OFF,
   MEASURING THE SHARK'S TEETH. OTHERS WATCH HIM. CHARLIE AND
   DENHERDER WALK OVER TO THE SHARK. CHARLIE PUNCHES IT.

   BRODY AND VAUGHN

   THEY ARE WALKING DOWN TO THE SHARK TOGETHER.

                         VAUGHN
             WHO'S THAT YOUNG MAN?

                         BRODY
             MATT HOOPER, THE SPECIALIST THEY
             SEND DOWN FROM THE OCEANOGRAPHIC
             INSTITUTE.

                         VAUGHN
                  (SPEAKING TO EVERYONE)
             I THINK WE ALL OWE A DEBT OF GRATITUDE
             TO THESE MEN FOR CATCHING THIS
             MONSTER.

   BRODY AND VAUGHN ARE BY NOW NEAR THE CIRCLE OF FISHERMEN,
   WHO ARE SURROUNDING HOOPER, RAISING THEIR VOICES AT HIM.

                         PRATT
             WHADYA MEAN, 'BITE RADIUS?' WHAT'S
             THAT?

                         GAFFER
             TEETH ARE TEETH, RIGHT?

                         HOOPER
             I DIDN'T SAY THIS WASN'T THE SHARK,
             I JUST SAID I WASN'T SURE THIS WAS
             THE ONE...

                         BRODY
             WHAT D'YA MEAN?

                         HOOPER
             THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF DIFFERENT KINDS
             OF SHARKS; MAKOS, BLUES, HAMMERHEADS,
             WHITE-TIPS... ANY ONE OF THEM COULD'VE
             ATTACKED. LOOK -- SHARK DIGESTION IS
             SLOW. WE COULD OPEN THIS ONE UP, AND
             FIND WHATEVER HE'S BEEN EATING IS
             STILL INSIDE.

                         VAUGHN
             THAT'S DISGUSTING! THIS IS THE
             LARGEST, MEANEST, MOST VICIOUS SHARK
             EVER LANDED OFF AMITY ISLAND, AND A
             KNOWN MANEATER!

                         HOOPER
             LET'S JUST CUT HIM OPEN AND SEE WHAT'S
             INSIDE...

                         BRODY
             WHY NOT, LARRY? WE COULD GET A
             POSITIVE CONFIRMATION THAT WAY.

                         VAUGHN
             BE REASONABLE, BOYS -- THIS ISN'T
             THE TIME OR THE PLACE TO DO SOME
             KIND OF HALF-ASSED AUTOPSY ON A FISH.
             BEN...
                  (TO MEADOWS)
             DO YOU HAVE ALL THE PICTURES YOU
             NEED?

                         MEADOWS
             PLENTY.

                         HOOPER
             WAIT A MINUTE...

   FELIX, PRATT AND THE OTHERS AD LIB DISAGREEMENT. "YOU'RE NOT
   GONNA CUT UP MY TROPHY," ETC.

                         VAUGHN
                  (SEEING SOMETHING
                  OFFSTAGE, WITH LOW
                  INTENSITY)
             I AM NOT GOING TO STAND HERE AND
             WATCH THIS FISH CUT OPEN AND SEE
             SOME KID FALL OUT ON THE DOCK.
             BESIDES...
                  (HE INDICATES OFF)

   WE SEE MRS. KINTNER APPROACHING, DRESSED IN BLACK.

                         VAUGHN
                  (TO BRODY)
             CHIEF, I'LL TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR
             THIS. BOYS, CUT THIS UGLY SONOFABITCH
             DOWN BEFORE HE STINKS UP THE WHOLE
             ISLAND. HARVE, TOMORROW YOU AND CARL
             TAKE HIM OUT AND DUMP HIM RIGHT IN
             THE DRINK.

   MRS. KINTNER JOINS THE GROUP

   SHE SEEKS OUT BRODY, AND STOPS IN FRONT OF HIM.

                         MRS. KINTNER
             CHIEF BRODY?

   HE NODS, SHE SLAPS HIM FULL ACROSS THE FACE. THERE IS AN
   EMBARRASSED SILENCE. SOME PEOPLE LEAVE, FOLLOWING A TREND
   THAT BEGAN WITH THE FIRST MENTION OF CUTTING OPEN THE SHARK.

                         MRS. KINTNER
             MY ALEX WAS A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE BOY
             AND YOU KILLED HIM. DID YOU KNOW
             THAT? YOU KNEW THERE WAS A SHARK OUT
             THERE. YOU KNEW A GIRL GOT KILLED
             HERE LAST WEEK. I JUST FOUND THAT
             OUT. BUT YOU KNEW. YOU KNEW IT WAS
             DANGEROUS, BUT YOU LET PEOPLE GO
             SWIMMING ANYWAY. YOU KNEW ALL THOSE
             THINGS, AND STILL MY BOY IS DEAD NOW
             AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT
             THAT. MY BOY IS DEAD. I WANTED YOU
             TO KNOW THAT.

   SHE STOPS, UNABLE TO CONTINUE. HER FATHER TAKES HER ARM AND
   LEADS HER AWAY. PRATT, HARRY AND THE OTHERS TRAIL OFF AFTER
   HER. DURING THE REST OF THE SCENE, THE CAMERA TIGHTENS IN ON
   BRODY TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE OTHERS.

                         VAUGHN
             I'M SORRY, MARTIN. SHE'S IN A SICK,
             TERRIBLE STATE.

                         HOOPER
             LOOK, MAYBE THIS IS THE WRONG TIME
             TO PURSUE THIS, BUT I'M NOT SURE...

   BEFORE HOOPER CAN FINISH, BRODY'S SHOULDERS SLUMP AND HE
   GOES SLACK.

                         BRODY
                  (ALMOST TO HIMSELF)
             SHE'S RIGHT.

                         VAUGHN
             LET'S ALL GET OUT OF HERE, THIS PLACE
             STINKS.

                         BRODY
             I'M GOING HOME.

   HE TURNS AND LEAVES ABRUPTLY, SURRENDERING THE DOCK TO VAUGHN
   AND HOOPER, WHO EYE EACH OTHER WITH MUTUAL DIS-ADMIRATION.

   INT. BRODY HOUSE - NIGHT - DINING ROOM

   BRODY AND ELLEN, SEAN AND MICHAEL, HAVE ALL FINISHED DINNER.

   BRODY'S PLATE IS UNTOUCHED, A VIRGIN MEATLOAF. HIS GLASS, ON
   THE OTHER HAND, IS WELL USED, WITH THE REMNANTS OF A STIFF
   SCOTCH AND ICE. HE IS STARING ACROSS THE TABLE AT THE
   YOUNGEST, SEAN, WHO MAKES A FACE AT HIM. HE MAKES A FACE
   BACK.

   THEY PLAY THIS GAME TOGETHER FOR A FEW MINUTES.

                         BRODY
             C'MERE AND GIVE DADDY A KISS.

                         SEAN
             WHY?

                         BRODY
             BECAUSE HE NEEDS IT.

   SEAN GIVES DADDY THE KISS. BRODY SHOOS HIM AND MICHAEL OFF
   TO BED. ELLEN, WHO IS FEELING PROGRESSIVELY MORE LEFT OUT
   WITH EACH PASSING MOMENT, GETS UP ABRUPTLY AND CLEARS A FEW
   DISHES. BRODY IS NOT LETTING HER INTO HIS WORLD FOR THE
   MOMENT, AND IT SHOWS. THERE'S A KNOCK AT THE DOOR.

                         HOOPER (O.S.)
             MARTIN BRODY RESIDENCE?

   ELLEN OPENS THE DOOR FOR HIM.

                         HOOPER
             HI. I'M MATT HOOPER. IF YOUR HUSBAND
             IS HERE, I'D LIKE TO TALK TO HIM.

                         ELLEN
             SO WOULD I. COME ON IN.

   HOOPER ENTERS. HE'S CARRYING A COUPLE OF BOTTLES OF WINE
   WHICH HE PICKED UP IN TOWN. HE SITS DOWN NEAR BRODY.

                         ELLEN
             WOULD YOU LIKE SOMETHING? SOME COFFEE?

                         HOOPER
                  (SEEING BRODY'S PLATE)
             IS ANYONE HAVING THIS...?

   HE STARTS IN ON IT, AS SOON AS SOMEONE HAS INDICATED "GO
   AHEAD."

                         HOOPER
             DYNAMITE!
                  (TO BRODY)
             HOW WAS YOUR DAY...?

                         BRODY
             SWELL.

   THEY EXCHANGE A LONG LOOK THAT EVOLVES INTO A SLIGHTLY
   DESPERATE, BUT SHARED LAUGHTER.

                         HOOPER
                  (PRODUCING WINE)
             HERE... ONE RED, ONE WHITE.

   THEY LAUGH SOME MORE. ELLEN IS AGAIN LEFT OUT OF IT.

                         HOOPER
                  (BONING HIS FISH)
             UMMM. REALLY GOOD.

   BRODY BEGINS STRIPPING THE FOIL OFF THE WINE, SCREWING IN A
   CORKSCREW, ETC.

                         ELLEN
             MY HUSBAND TELLS ME YOU'RE IN SHARKS.

                         HOOPER
             I WOULDN'T PUT IT THAT WAY. BUT I
             LOVE SHARKS.

                         ELLEN
             YOU LOVE SHARKS?

                         HOOPER
             I DO.
                  (HE TELLS A STORY
                  ABOUT HIS BOYHOOD
                  AND A SHARK)
             BUT YOU'VE STILL GOT A PROBLEM HERE,
             THERE'S A SHARK JUST OFF THE ISLAND
             SOMEWHERE.

                         BRODY
             HOW COME YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM THAT?

                         ELLEN
             EXCUSE ME, BUT WHAT ARE YOU TALKING
             ABOUT? DIDN'T THEY CATCH THE SHARK
             THIS AFTERNOON? IT WAS ON THE CAPE
             STATION NEWS.

                         HOOPER
             THEY CAUGHT A SHARK, NOT THE SHARK.
             BIG DIFFERENCE. I COULD'VE PROVED IT
             THIS AFTERNOON, BY CUTTING THAT ONE
             OPEN AND EXAMINING HIS STOMACH
             CONTENTS. ALSO, HIS BITE WAS TOO
             SMALL.

   BRODY HAS THE CORK OUT OF THE WINE. POP.

                         HOOPER
             I WAS LUCKY TO FIND THAT IN TOWN --
             IT'S AN ESTATE BOTTLED VINTAGE YEAR...

   BRODY TAKES THE FINE WINE, AND POURS IT INTO HIS DRINK GLASS
   FILLING THE TUMBLER TO THE TOP WITH ICE CUBES, DILUTED SCOTCH,
   AND THE WINE.

                         HOOPER
                  (AS BRODY POURS)
             WE OUGHT TO LET IT BREATHE...
             WHATEVER.

                         BRODY
             LET'S ALL HAVE A DRINK.

   HE EXTENDS THE BOTTLE TO HOOPER, WHO POLITELY ACCEPTS A TOKEN
   SIP. HE TAKES SOME FOR HIMSELF, AND OFFERS SOME TO ELLEN.

                         BRODY
             YOU TOO, SWEETHEART...

                         ELLEN
             THANK YOU.

                         HOOPER
                  (TOASTING)
             HERE'S TO YOUR HUSBAND, THE ONLY
             OTHER RATIONAL MAN ON THE ISLAND.
             DAY AFTER TOMORROW, I'LL BE GONE,
             AND HE'LL BE THE ONLY ONE.

                         ELLEN
             YOU'RE LEAVING?

                         HOOPER
             GOING OUT ON THE 'AURORA.'

                         ELLEN
             IS THAT A BOAT?

                         HOOPER
             IS IT! THE BEST-FUNDED RESEARCH
             EXPEDITION TO EVER STUDY THE SHARK...
             AROUND THE WORLD IN 18 MONTHS.

                         ELLEN
             LIKE THOSE COUSTEAU SPECIALS ON
             TELEVISION? I THINK IT'S FOR THE
             KIDS, BUT I LOVE THEM.

                         HOOPER
             BETTER THAN COUSTEAU, OR COMPAGNO
             WITH COMPUTERS, TELEMETRY, DEFENSE
             DEPARTMENT FUNDING...

                         ELLEN
             I SAW A SHOW WITH SEA OTTERS, AND A
             BIG TURTLE... MIKEY LOVED IT. MADE
             ME PROMISE TO GET HIM ONE. WILL YOU
             LIVE ON THE BOAT?

                         HOOPER
             YEP.

                         ELLEN
             MARTIN HATES BOATS. HATES THE WATER.
             ON THE FERRY TO THE MAINLAND, HE
             SITS IN THE CAR THE WHOLE WAY OVER.
             HE'S GOT THIS CHILDHOOD THING, THERE'S
             A CLINICAL WORD FOR IT.

                         BRODY
             DROWNING. LEMME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
             IS IT TRUE MOST ATTACKS TAKE PLACE
             IN THREE FEET OF WATER, AROUND 10
             FEET FROM THE BEACH?

                         HOOPER
             YEAH. LIKE THE KID ON YOUR BEACH.
             I WISH I COULD'VE EXAMINED THAT SHARK
             THEY CAUGHT...

                         BRODY
             SOMETHING ELSE. DO MOST ATTACKS GO
             UNREPORTED?

                         HOOPER
             ABOUT HALF OF THEM. A LOT OF 'MISSING
             SWIMMERS' ARE REALLY SHARK VICTIMS.

                         BRODY
             THERE'S A KIND OF A LONE SHARK,
             CALLED, UH...

                         HOOPER
             ROGUE?

                         BRODY
             YEAH. ROGUE. PICKS OUT AN AREA WHERE
             THERE'S FOOD AND HANGS OUT THERE AS
             LONG AS THE FOOD SUPPLY LASTS?

                         HOOPER
             IT'S CALLED TERRITORIALITY. IT'S A
             THEORY.

                         BRODY
             AND BEFORE 1900, WHEN PEOPLE FIRST
             STARTING SWIMMING FOR RECREATION,
             BEFORE PUBLIC BATHING AND RESORTS,
             THERE WERE VERY FEW SHARK ATTACKS,
             CAUSE SHARKS DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY
             WERE MISSING?

                         HOOPER
             YOU COULD SAY THAT.

   BRODY DIGESTS ALL THIS; CONFIRMATION OF FACTS HE HAS GLEANED
   IN HIS NEWLY ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE OF THE SHARK SPECIES.

   THERE IS A LONG PAUSE.

                         BRODY
             WHY DON'T WE HAVE ONE MORE DRINK,
             YOU AND I, AND THEN WE GO DOWN AND
             CUT OPEN THAT OLD SHARK AND SEE FOR
             SURE WHAT'S INSIDE HIM, OR NOT.

                         ELLEN
             CAN YOU DO THAT?

                         BRODY
             I AM CHIEF OF POLICE. I CAN DO
             ANYTHING I WANT.
                  (TO HOOPER)
             YOU WANT TO COME?

                         HOOPER
             I'M FLATTERED YOU SHOULD ASK.

   HE GETS UP AND THEY BOTH START OUT. ELLEN WATCHES THEM GO.

   INT. BOAT SHED - NIGHT

   DARK, SPOOKY SHED, WITH SHADOWS OF BOATS AND STRANGE
   SILHOUETTES OF BOAT PARTS AND SCAFFOLDING. AT ONE END, THE
   LARGE, SYMMETRICAL BULK OF THE SHARK'S CARCASS LIES ON A
   TARP. A SINGLE DARK FIGURE IS BENDING OVER THE DEAD SHARK.

   THE LARGE DOUBLE DOORS AT ONE END OF THE SHED SQUEAK OPEN,
   AND THE SHADOWY FIGURE MOVES ABRUPTLY AWAY FROM THE SHARK.

   THE NEW ENTRANTS MOVE INTO THE SHED. IT IS HOOPER AND BRODY
   AND THEY ARE CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION BEGUN IN THE CAR ON
   THE WAY OVER.

   AS THE SHADOWY FIGURE MOVES SILENTLY INTO A VANTAGE POINT
   AGAINST ONE WALL, HE PASSES THROUGH THE LIGHT FROM A WINDOW;
   IT IS QUINT, AND WE ONLY SEE HIM LONG ENOUGH TO RECOGNIZE
   HIM AS HE BACKS AGAINST THE WALL.

                         HOOPER
             ...AND IT WAS DARTMOUTH WINTER
             WEEKEND, AND SHE WAS HOMECOMING QUEEN,
             AND I WAS HER DATE; THEN SHE GOT
             INTO THE FACT THAT HER FAMILY HAD
             MORE MONEY THAN MY FAMILY, AND SHE
             WAS RIGHT -- HER GREAT-GRANDFATHER
             WAS IN MINING, AND MY ANCESTORS WERE
             YANKEE SHIPBUILDERS. SO WE BROKE UP
             AND I WENT HOME WITH SOME BEATNIK
             FROM SARAH LAWRENCE.

                         BRODY
             WHAT STINKS SO BAD?

                         HOOPER
             OUR FRIEND, THE SHARK.

   THEY BEND OVER THE SHAPE LIKE 18TH CENTURY GRAVEROBBERS.

                         HOOPER
             WE ALWAYS HAD A SUMMER PLACE ON THE
             WATER -- NEWPORT, THE VINEYARD, SO I
             FIGURED I'D MAJOR IN SOMETHING I
             KNEW ABOUT. OCEANOGRAPHY, MARINE
             BIOLOGY. IT WAS THAT, OR DESIGN RACING
             YACHTS LIKE MY OLDER BROTHER. HMMM.
             HE WE GO. UP THE OLD ALIMENTARY CANAL.
             HOLD THE LIGHT.

   WE HEAR A SLURP AND A SQUISH AS HOOPER PRODUCES A BIG KNIFE
   AND DIPS INTO THE SHARK WITH A MAJOR INCISION.

                         HOOPER
             WE OPEN THE ABDOMINAL CAVITY AND
             CHECK THE DIGESTIVE TRACT. SIMPLE.
                  (HE ATTENDS TO HIS
                  WORK)

   FROM HIS VANTAGE POINT, QUINT WATCHES, UNSEEN BY THE TWO
   MEN.

   BRODY IS HOLDING THE LIGHT, FIGHTING THE GAG REFLEX,
   FASCINATED BY THE BIZARRE RITUAL.

                         BRODY
             WHAT'S THAT?

                         HOOPER
             HALF A FLOUNDER. HMMM... A BURLAP
             BAG... A PAINT CAN... AHA!

                         BRODY
             WHAT? WHAT?!

                         HOOPER
             JUST AS I THOUGHT. HE DRIFTED UP
             HERE WITH THE GULF STREAM, FROM
             SOUTHERN WATERS.

                         BRODY
             HOW CAN YOU TELL?

                         HOOPER
                  (SHOWING IT)
             FLORIDA LICENSE PLATE.

                         BRODY
             HE ATE A CAR?

                         HOOPER
                  (LAUGHS)
             NO, BUT TIGER SHARKS ARE THE GARBAGE
             CANS OF THE OCEAN. THEY EAT ANYTHING.
             BUT THIS ONE DIDN'T EAT ANY PEOPLE.
             THERE'S NOTHING HERE...

   HE KICKS THE REMAINS AROUND BELOW CAMERA.

                         HOOPER
             ...NOTHING.

                         BRODY
             WHAT DO WE DO?

                         HOOPER
             IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SHARK, YOU
             DON'T LOOK ON LAND. YOU GO OUT AND
             CHUM FOR HIM.

                         BRODY
             CHUM?

                         HOOPER
             ONLY ONE SURE WAY TO FIND HIM --
             OFFER HIM A LITTLE SOMETHING TO EAT.
             CHUM -- BLOOD, WASTE MEAT, FISH,
             ANYTHING. THEY CAN SENSE IT MILES
             AWAY. IF HE'S OUT THERE, WE MIGHT BE
             ABLE TO GET A CLOSER LOOK AT HIM.
                  (CHECKS HIS WATCH)
             IT'S A GOOD TIME, TOO. THEY'RE NIGHT
             FEEDERS...

   EXT. ABOARD HOOPER'S BOAT - NIGHT (TANK)

   WE SEE BRODY, LOOKING SICK AND NERVOUS, HOLDING ON ANXIOUSLY
   AS THE "FASCINATIN' RHYTHM" MOVES SLOWLY AHEAD TROLLING AT
   NIGHT. HIS GLASSES ARE ALREADY FLECKED WITH THE WHITE SALT
   OF DRIED SEAWATER. HE IS WEARING A LIFE-PRESERVER.

   HOOPER IS AT THE WHEEL, A CHART SPREAD IN FRONT OF HIM, HIS
   EYES SCANNING THE SEA RESTLESSLY, CHECKING THE DIALS AND
   GAUGES IN FRONT OF HIM AS WELL AS THE ELECTRONIC DEPTH-FINDING
   AND "FISH-FINDER" GEAR MOUNTED IN THE COCKPIT. A GREEN GLOW
   SHINES FROM THE INSTRUMENTS ON HIS FACE. TWO CLOSED-CIRCUIT
   TV CAMERAS MOUNTED BELOW THE HULL FLASH THEIR PICTURES ONTO
   MONITORS IN THE DASH.

   IN THE AISLE BETWEEN THE SEATS IS A LARGE CONTAINER FILLED
   WITH UNPLEASANT-LOOKING BAIT; HOOPER IS LONG-LINING FOR SIGNS
   OF SHARK, AND CHUMMING.

                         HOOPER
                  (INDICATING DISTANT
                  FLASHING BEACON)
             THAT'S THE CAPE LIGHT -- WE'RE ON
             THE STRETCH WHERE HE'S FEEDING, IF
             HE'S STILL HERE.

   BRODY, BORED, TIRED, AND SLIGHTLY QUEASY, IS TRYING TO
   CONCENTRATE ON ANYTHING BUT THE MOTION OF THE BOAT. HE STARES
   AT THE SOPHISTICATED ELECTRONICS DISPLAYS.

                         BRODY
             WHAT IS ALL THIS STUFF?

                         HOOPER
                  (TICKING THEM OFF)
             DEPTH-FINDER, FATHOMETER, SONAR,
             CLOSED-CIRCUIT TV -- FORE AND AFT --
             RDF, SINGLE SIDE BAND...
                  (POINTS TO THEMSELVES)
             AND TWO LOOSE NUTS BEHIND THE WHEEL.

                         BRODY
             CAN YOU TELL FROM THAT IF A BIG MAN-
             EATER IS AROUND?

                         HOOPER
             SOMETIMES.
                  (INDICATES DISPLAY)
             LOOK HERE -- SOMETHING BIG, PROBABLY
             A SCHOOL OF MACKEREL CLUMPED TOGETHER.
             AND STAYING RIGHT WITH US.

   INSERT - ELECTRONICS SCREEN

   IT'S BLIPPING AND PEEPING.

   CLOSE ON THE TWO MEN

                         BRODY
             WHERE'D YOU GET ALL THIS?

                         HOOPER
             I BOUGHT IT.  BOTH SETS OF
             GRANDPARENTS SET UP TRUST FUNDS FOR
             ME; STOCKS WENT UP, SO I DON'T HAVE
             TO TOUCH MY PRINCIPAL.

                         BRODY
             YOU'RE AT THE INSTITUTE FULL TIME?
             OR DO YOU HAVE A JOB?

                         HOOPER
                  (A NERVE HAS BEEN
                  TOUCHED)
             IT IS A JOB. I'M NOT FOOLING AROUND
             LIKE SOME AMATEUR. IT'S MY LIFE!

                         BRODY
             WE GOTTA GET BACK SOON...

   WIDE ON THE "FASCINATIN' RHYTHM" AS IT SWINGS AROUND

   THE TWO MEN LOOKING VERY SMALL AND VULNERABLE IN THE OPEN
   SEA, THE LOW-HANGING MIST OBSCURING THEIR VISIBILITY IN THE
   NIGHT.

   CLOSE ON BRODY

   HE HEARS SOMETHING, HIS EYES WIDEN. IT IS THE "BUMP-THUMP"
   OF SOMETHING SCRAPING THE HULL.

                         BRODY
             HEY!

   HOOPER LOOKS UP AND CUTS THE WHEEL HARD, AS THE SAME TIME
   DROPPING THE ENGINES INTO NEUTRAL, AND THEN REVERSE. THE
   SUDDEN CHANGE THROWS BRODY TO HIS KNEES.

                         BRODY
             WHAT THE HELL?

   ANGLE FROM HOOPER'S BOAT: GARDNER'S BOAT "FLICKA" AWASH AND
   FLOATING DEAD IN THE SEA

   IT'S WHAT THEY'VE JUST RUN INTO -- FLOODED TO THE GUNWALES,
   LOOSE DEBRIS FLOATING AROUND, A TANGLE OF LINES AND GEAR
   LOOKING LIKE FLOATING GARBAGE IN THE COCKPIT. HOOPER'S LIGHT
   SWEEPS ACROSS IT.

                         BRODY
             THAT'S BEN GARDNER'S BOAT! IT'S THE
             FLICKA! BEN? BEN!

   HOOPER CUTS HIS ENGINES AND DRIFTS IN; HE SCAMPERS OUT TO
   THE BOW OF HIS BOAT AND MAKES A LINE FAST TO THE FLICKA.

   INSIDE THE COCKPIT OF HOOPER'S BOAT

   THE ELECTRONIC DISPLAY IS SHOWING INCREASED ACTIVITY, BUT
   ONLY BRODY, WHO IS CLINGING TO A SUPPORT FOR DEAR LIFE, CAN
   SEE THE BLIPS AND HEAR THE CHATTER. HOOPER IS LEANING OUT TO
   LOOK AT THE FLICKA.

   THE TWO BOATS

   HOOPER IS EXAMINING THE FLICKA, TYING A TOWLINE TO IT.

   INSERT HIS POINT OF VIEW

   THE LIGHT PICKS ITS WAY ACROSS THE RUINED BOAT. THE RAIL
   WHERE A CLEAT ONCE WAS IS BROADLY SCARRED DOWN TO THE RAW
   TIMBER, AND THE HEADY CLEAT HAS BEEN TORN BODILY OUT OF THE
   HULL, RIPPED OUT SCREWS AND ALL.

   HOOPER'S BOAT

   SOMETHING HE HAS SEEN MOVES HOOPER.

                         BRODY
             WHAT HAPPENED?

                         HOOPER
             I WANT TO CHECK SOMETHING. HOLD MY
             FEET.

   HE STICKS HIS HEAD OVER THE SIDE, INTO THE BLACK WATER.

                         BRODY
             DON'T THEY HAVE LIFEJACKETS OR
             SOMETHING? AN EXTRA BOAT?

                         HOOPER
                  (SURFACING)
             THEY MUST'VE HIT SOMETHING.

   INSERT, ELECTRONICS DISPLAY

   BLIP, CHATTER, BLIP, CHATTER.

   BRODY AND HOOPER

   HOOPER MOVES TO GET A BETTER LOOK, THE BOAT ROCKS IN THE
   SWELL AND FROM HIS MOVEMENT, BRODY CLUTCHES THE RAIL IN A
   DEATH-GRIP.

   HOOPER GOES BELOW DECKS, GETTING INTO HIS WET SUIT, BUCKLING
   ON A WEIGHTED BELT, HOLDING A MASK AND HOT FLASHLIGHT.

                         HOOPER
             HE DIDN'T HAVE A DINGHY ABOARD. I'M
             GOING DOWN TO TAKE A LOOK AT HIS
             HULL.

                         BRODY
             WHY DON'T WE JUST TOW IT IN?

                         HOOPER
                  (HYPERVENTILATING)
             WE WILL. THERE'S SOMETHING I'VE GOT
             TO FIND OUT.

                         BRODY
             BE CAREFUL, FOR CHRISSAKE.

   HOOPER TAKES A LAST FEW BREATHS, ORIENTS HIMSELF, TAKES A
   LONG, HARD LOOK AT THE QUIET, OPEN OCEAN, AND FALLS INTO THE
   SEA.

   CLOSE ON BRODY

   HE IS STUDYING THE SURFACE, TRYING TO FOLLOW HOOPER'S
   MOVEMENTS. BRODY IS FORCING HIMSELF TO STAY AT THE EDGE OF
   THE BOAT BY SHEER WILLPOWER AND GRIM DETERMINATION. BRODY IS
   FASCINATED BY THE SEA LIKE A BIRD FACING A COBRA. HE IS VERY
   MUCH ALONE. HE GRASPS A FLASHLIGHT OR BOATHOOK AS A FRAGILE
   DEFENSE AGAINST THE UNKNOWN.

   PAST BRODY'S BACK TO THE ELECTRONICS

   BEEP, CHATTER, BLIP.

   UNDERWATER SEQUENCE - HOOPER

   HOOPER DESCENDS IN A FROTH OF BUBBLES. WARILY HE TURNS A
   FULL CIRCLE WITH HIS HOTLIGHT. AT FIRST WE SEE NOTHING OUT
   OF PLACE ABOUT THE FLICKA EXCEPT THAT IT IS LYING SO LOW IN
   THE WATER. BUT AS HOOPER TRAVELS THE BOTTOM LOOKING FOR
   DAMAGE, HE COMES ACROSS A JAGGED HOLE TWO-THIRDS OF THE WAY
   FORWARD.

   THE HOLE IS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BASKETBALL, AND THE WOOD
   AROUND IT HAS BEEN BASHED AND SPLINTERED. HOOPER EXPLORES
   THE HOLE WITH HIS HANDS, THEN TAKES THE KNIFE FROM ITS SHEATH
   AND BEGINS TO DIG AT SOMETHING. WHATEVER IT IS COMES FREE IN
   HIS HAND. AS HE STUDIES HIS FIND, HIS LIGHT WANDERS UPWARD,
   POINTING DIRECTLY INTO THE DARK HOLE. HOOPER LOOKS UP...

   CLOSE - HOLE

   BEN GARDNER'S DEAD FACE STARES OUT THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE
   FLICKA, EYES AND MOUTH GAPING IN FROZEN HORROR, HIS SKIN
   PINCHED LIKE A PRUNE.

   CLOSE - HOOPER

   BUMPS HIS HEAD IN TRYING TO GET AWAY, SEEMS TO YELL THROUGH
   ESCAPING BUBBLES. WE HEAR THE GASPING SHOUT AS A BUBBLING
   ROAR IN THE EARS. HIS MASK FILLS WITH WATER AS HE FLAILS FOR
   THE SURFACE. MISCALCULATING, HE BUMPS INTO THE HULL OF HIS
   OWN BOAT, SHOCKED, DISMAYED, HIS SYSTEM JANGLING WITH
   ADRENALINE SHOCK, HIS HANDS OPEN, AND THE OBJECT HE PRIED
   LOOSE FROM THE HULL DRIFTS DOWN AND OUT, FALLING INTO THE
   ETERNITY OF THE OCEAN BOTTOM. HE FINALLY BURSTS THROUGH THE
   SURFACE.

   END OF UNDERWATER SEQUENCE

   THE BOAT, HOOPER EMERGING FROM THE WATER

   HE IS GASPING FOR BREATH, HIS WHOLE BODY VIBRATING WITH
   URGENCY. THE SALT WATER IN HIS LUNGS COMBINES WITH THE
   ADRENALINE IN HIS BLOOD TO DEPRIVE HIM OF SPEECH.

                         BRODY
             YOU ALL RIGHT?

                         HOOPER
             A WHITE! A GREAT WHITE, I FOUND A
             TOOTH BURIED IN THE HULL. HE MUST'VE
             ATTACKED... I KNEW IT... GARDNER'S
             DEAD IN THERE. I DIDN'T SEE THE
             MATE...

                         BRODY
             NO SHARK DID THAT TO A BOAT!

   HOOPER, DESPITE HIS SHOCK AND SURPRISE, IS STRANGELY ELATED,
   ALMOST GIDDY WITH THE WONDER OF HIS DISCOVERY.

                         HOOPER
             JESUS CHRIST! A GREAT WHITE! WHO'D
             BELIEVE IT! WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT
             A SHARK, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SHARK!

   BRODY SINKS WEAKLY INTO A CHAIR. BRODY HUDDLES IN THE STERN,
   HOOPER KICKS THE ENGINE IN WITH A ROAR, AND STILL A-SHIVER
   WITH EXCITEMENT, TURNS THE BOAT AND ITS GRIM TOW BACK TO
   PORT.

   EXT. ISLAND HIGHWAY - THE BILLBOARD - DAY

   NEXT TO THE "AMITY WELCOMES YOU" BILLBOARD IS A GROUP OF
   SELECTMEN, VAUGHN, MEADOWS, HENDRICKS, AND ANOTHER DEPUTY
   STANDING BY WITH PAINT AND BRUSHES. BRODY'S WAGON IS THERE,
   ALONG WITH A FEW OTHER CARS. BUSY LATE AFTERNOON TRAFFIC IS
   STARTING TO PILE UP AS EARLY WEEKENDERS AND CURIOSITY SEEKERS
   SLOW DOWN TO SEE WHAT'S HAPPENING.

   BEHIND THE BILLBOARD, BRODY AND HOOPER HAVE GOTTEN VAUGHN TO
   ONE SIDE. THEY ARE MAKING A CLOSELY REASONED PRESENTATION TO
   HIM.

                         BRODY
             THERE IS A KIND OF SHARK CALLED A
             GREAT WHITE SHARK THAT EVERY EXPERT
             IN THE WORLD AGREES IS A MANEATER.

                         HOOPER
             YOU'RE SITUATION HERE SUGGESTS THAT
             A GREAT WHITE HAS STAKED OUT A CLAIM
             IN THE WATERS AROUND AMITY ISLAND,
             AND THAT HE WILL CONTINUE TO FEED
             HERE AS LONG AS THERE IS FOOD IN THE
             WATER.

                         BRODY
             THERE'S NO LIMITS TO WHERE HE CAN
             STRIKE, AND WE'VE HAD THREE ATTACKS
             AND TWO DEATHS IN THE PAST FEW DAYS.
             IT HAPPENED LIKE THIS BEFORE, IN
             1916, WHEN A GREAT WHITE KILLED FIVE
             SWIMMERS AT JONES BEACH, IN LONG
             ISLAND.

                         HOOPER
             A SHARK'S ATTACK IS STIMULATED BY
             THE KIND OF SPLASHING AND ACTIVITY
             THAT OCCURS WHENEVER HUMANS GO
             SWIMMING -- YOU CAN'T AVOID IT!

                         BRODY
             A 4TH OF JULY BEACH IS LIKE RINGING
             A DINNER BELL, FOR CHRISSAKE!

                         HOOPER
             I JUST PULLED A SHARK TOOTH THE SIZE
             OF A SHOT GLASS OUT OF THE HULL OF A
             WRECKED BOAT OUT THERE.

                         BRODY
             WE TOWED BEN GARDNER'S BOAT IN, LARRY;
             HE WAS DEAD AND HIS BOAT WAS ALL
             CHEWED UP.

                         VAUGHN
             IS THAT TOOTH HERE? DID ANYONE SEE
             IT?

             HOOPER
     I DON'T HAVE IT.

                                           BRODY
                                   HE LOST IT ON THE WAY UP.

                         VAUGHN
             WHAT KIND OF A SHARK DID YOU SAY IT
             WAS?

                         HOOPER
             CARCARADON CARCHARIAS. A GREAT WHITE.

                         VAUGHN
             WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO COMMIT ECONOMIC
             SUICIDE ON THAT FLIMSY EVIDENCE. WE
             DEPEND ON THE SUMMER PEOPLE FOR OUR
             LIVES, AND IF OUR BEACHES ARE CLOSED,
             THEN WE'RE ALL FINISHED.

                         BRODY
             WE HAVE GOT TO CLOSE THE BEACHES. WE
             HAVE GOT TO GET SOMEONE TO KILL THE
             SHARK, WE NEED NON-CORROSIVE MESH
             NETTING, WE NEED SCIENTIFIC SUPPORT...
             IT'S GONNA COST MONEY JUST TO KEEP
             THE NUTS OUT AND SAVE WHAT WE HAVE.

                         VAUGHN
             I DON'T THING EITHER OF YOU IS
             FAMILIAR WITH OUR PROBLEMS...

                         HOOPER
             I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT YOU
             ARE GOING TO IGNORE THIS THING UNTIL
             IT SWIMS UP AND BITES YOU ON THE
             ASS! THERE ARE ONLY TWO WAYS TO SOLVE
             THIS THING: YOU CAN KILL IT, OR YOU
             CAN CUT OFF ITS FOOD SUPPLY...

                         BRODY
             THAT MEANS CLOSING THE BEACHES.

                         VAUGHN
             COME HERE, I WANT TO SHOW YOU
             SOMETHING.

   HE LEADS BRODY AROUND TO THE FRONT OF THE BILLBOARD, ON WHICH
   WE SEE THAT SOME PRANKSTERS HAVE PAINTED A HUGE SHARK FIN IN
   THE WATER BEHIND THE SWIMMER, SO SHE LOOKS NOW LIKE A FRANTIC
   BATHER FLEEING A PURSUING MONSTER.

                         VAUGHN
             SICK VANDALISM! BRODY, THAT'S A
             DELIBERATE MUTILATION OF A PUBLIC
             SERVICE MESSAGE! I WANT THOSE LITTLE
             PAINT-HAPPY BASTARDS CAUGHT AND HUNG
             UP BY THEIR BABY BUSTER BROWNS!

                         HOOPER
                  (WHO HAS FOLLOWED
                  THEM AROUND)
             THAT'S IT! I'M STANDING HERE ARGUING
             WITH A GUY WHO CAN'T WAIT TO BE A
             HOT LUNCH. GOODBYE.

                         BRODY
             WAIT A MINUTE! I NEED YOU.

                         HOOPER
             OUT THERE IS A PERFECT ENGINE, AN
             EATING MACHINE THAT IS A MIRACLE OF
             EVOLUTION -- IT SWIMS AND EATS AND
             THAT'S ALL. LOOK AT THAT! THOSE
             PROPORTIONS ARE CORRECT.
                  (INDICATES FIN)
             I KNOW SHARKS.

                         VAUGHN
             YOU'D LOVE TO PROVE THAT. GETTING
             YOUR NAME IN THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC.

                         BRODY
             LARRY, WE CAN RE-OPEN THE BEACHES IN
             AUGUST.

                         VAUGHN
             AUGUST! TOMORROW IS THE 4TH OF JULY,
             AND WE ARE GOING TO OPEN FOR BUSINESS.
             IT'S GOING TO BE OUR BEST SUMMER IN
             YEARS. IF YOU'RE SO CONCERNED ABOUT
             THE BEACHES, YOU TWO, YOU DO WHATEVER
             YOU HAVE TO TO KEEP THEM SAFE, BUT
             WITH YOU OR WITHOUT YOU, THE BEACHES
             STAY OPEN THIS WEEKEND.

   INT. FERRY BOAT - DAY

   TWO CAVERNOUS IRON DOORS. THEN A CRACK OF VERTICAL LIGHT AS
   SIX BURLY CREWMEN MUSCLE THEM APART. THE AMITY FERRY LANDING
   IS APPROACHING, PEOPLE IN COLORFUL OUTFITS WAITING DOCKSIDE
   FOR THE FIRST FILLED-TO-CAPACITY SHUTTLE OF THE SUMMER SEASON
   AND --

   BACH'S LITTLE FUGUE IS THE MUSICAL ACCOMPANIMENT TO THIS
   WHOLLY VISUAL MONTAGE OF DISEMBARKATION. THE NEXT TWO MINUTES
   SHOULD BE TREATED LIKE A "SHORT FILM" TAKING INTO ACCOUNT
   ALL OF THE COLORS, EPISODES, FACES AND BEHAVIOR OF A VARIETY
   OF AMERICANS WHO COLONIZE EASTERN RESORT COMMUNITIES FOR THE
   NINETY-DAY SEASON.

   INTERCUT WITH THIS MONTAGE IS BRODY'S HOME, WHERE ELLEN,
   HOOPER AND BRODY ARE IN SWEATY, GRITTY ALL-OUT EFFORT TO
   ENLIST SOME SUPPORT. ELEMENTS IN THIS MONTAGE INCLUDE:

   A.  A TRAIN OF CARS TRUNDLING DOWN THE RAMP, BUMPER TO BUMPER.

   B.  YOUNG BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE FROM PRINCETON, YALE, NYU, WEARING
   KNAPSACKS, TOTING LUGGAGE, BABIES RIDING IN PAPOOSE RIGS,
   ENERGIZED CHILDREN, SENIOR CITIZENS HOLDING HANDS ON THE
   PEDESTRIAN RAMP, A FEW WHEELCHAIRS.

   C.  HOOPER, BENT OVER THE PHONE: "I KNOW IT'S A LONG WEEKEND,
   COULD YOU GET ME HIS HOME PHONE NUMBER?

   D.  SIDEWALK VENDORS HAWKING "SHARK KILLED" SOUVENIRS, BIG
   PHOTO "PERSONALITY POSTERS" OF THE DEAD TIGER SHARK HUNG ON
   THE DOCK.

   E.  BRODY: "YOU'RE ACTING SENIOR OFFICER? WHERE'S CHIEF PETTY
   OFFICER FELDMAN? WHERE'S THE COAST GUARD EXECUTIVE OFFICER?"

   F.  SOUVENIR STANDS SELLING GENUINE SHARKS TEETH FROM THE
   AMITY KILLER SHARK, CAPTURED THIS WEEK.

   G.  AMITY CAB COMPANY, SMALL BLUE TOYOTAS LINED UP WITH THEIR
   COLLEGE STUDENT DRIVERS LIKE A BOMBER WING.

   H.  HOOPER:  "WELL THEN, OPERATOR, COULD YOU TRY HIM IN THE
   DINING ROOM?"

   I.  BRODY: "ALL I GET IS A RECORDING. IS THERE SOME OTHER
   NUMBER I COULD TRY...?"

   J.  STATION WAGONS WITH PALE WINTER FACES PRESSED ANXIOUSLY
   TO THE WINDOW. CADILLACS WITH REAR ADMIRALS AT THE HELM,
   THEIR WIVES WITH BLUE HAIR REMEMBERING THE WAY FROM YEARS
   BEFORE.

   K.  HOOPER: "WHEN DID HE CHECK OUT? DID HE LEAVE ANOTHER
   PHONE NUMBER?"

   L.  BRODY: "HOW CAN I REACH HIM IN CHAMBERS IF HE'S NOT IN
   CHAMBERS?"

   M.  LITTLE KARATE HANDS BREAKING PICKET FENCES.

   N.  SOME LOCAL DELINQUENTS ABOUT 10 OR 12 YEARS OLD, TOWING
   BEHIND THEIR BICYCLES A LITTLE DEAD SAND SHARK WITH SIGNS:
   "AMITY MONSTER SHARK." "KILLED HERE." 5 CENTS A HIT." ETC.

   THEN SIX BLONDE AND TANNED CONEY ISLAND MEATBALLS DESCEND
   THE RAMP. THEY ALL WEAR MEN'S CLUB LIFEGUARD PATCHES AND
   MATCHING COLLEGIATE WINDBREAKERS. THEY SCOUR THE LANDING,
   LOOKING FOR SOMEONE TO SAVE.

   THE BOAT IS EMPTY. EVERYBODY HEADING INLAND, ANTICIPATING
   THE BEST FOURTH OF JULY EVER. ALREADY THERE IS DEBRIS ON THE
   DOCKS AND THE CLEANING CREW WORKS AWAY AT IT.

   INSIDE THE FERRY

   AS BACH'S LITTLE FUGUE ENDS, THE SIX BURLY CREWMEN LEAN THEIR
   COMBINED WEIGHT AGAINST THE CATHEDRAL DOORS, CLOSING OUT THE
   LIGHT AND LOCKING IN THE TRADE. THE DOORS LATCH SHUT WITH A
   RESOUNDING CLANG!

   ANGLE ON BRODY, NERVOUSLY WATCHING THE BEACH

   HE IS STUDYING EVERYTHING, TRYING TO MAKE SURE HE HAS IT
   COVERED AS WELL AS POSSIBLE. HE ALMOST DOESN'T HEAR THE
   APPROACHING ROAR OF A SMALL HELICOPTER UNTIL IT SETTLES DOWN
   BEHIND HIM, AND A FLYING OFFICER GETS OUT, STARCHED, PRESSED
   FATIGUES, A FLAWLESS FATIGUE BASEBALL CAP, AND SLICK DARK
   AVIATOR'S SUNGLASSES. THE STEVE CANYON OF AMITY. HE PRESENTS
   BRODY WITH A CLIPBOARD.

                         OFFICER
             MARTIN BRODY?
                  (BRODY NODS)
             I'LL NEED YOUR SIGNATURE HERE...
             HERE... AND HERE.

                         BRODY
             WHAT IS THIS?

                         OFFICER
             AUTHORIZATION FOR DIRECT PAYMENT OF
             FLIGHT EXPENSES NOT DIRECTLY CONNECTED
             TO A NORMAL MISSION OF THIS COMMAND.
                  (BRODY DOESN'T
                  UNDERSTAND)
             YOU PAY FOR THE GAS.

   BRODY SIGNS. THE OFFICER SHAKES HIS HEAD AS BRODY MAKES AN
   ERROR.

                         BRODY
             I SIGNED ON THE WRONG LINE...

                         OFFICER
             JUST ERASE YOUR SIGNATURE AND INITIAL
             YOUR ERASURE.

   BRODY COMPLIES, SHAKING HIS HEAD. THE OFFICER SNAPS HIM A
   SALUTE, JOGS LIGHTLY BACK TO HIS IDLING COPTER, BUCKLES IN,
   AND GIVES BRODY A "THUMBS UP" AS HE LIFTS OFF IN A FLURRY OF
   SAND AND ICE-CREAM WRAPPERS.

   EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - EARLY MORNING

   AND THIS IS IT -- THE DAWN PATROL, THE ONLY FORCES THAT THE
   FRANTIC PHONE CALLING PRODUCED. HENDRICKS, AND THE REGULAR
   SUMMER EXTRA DEPUTIES. THE LIFEGUARDS. HALF A DOZEN STATE
   TROOPERS. SOME DEPUTIES FROM NEIGHBORING TOWNS, AND A COAST
   GUARD ENSIGN WITH A HANDFUL OF REGULARS IN WORK DUNGAREES.

   SOME OF HOOPER'S FRIENDS FROM THE INSTITUTE.

   BRODY AND HOOPER, BADLY IN NEED OF SLEEP, ARE WATCHING THE
   CREW STRAGGLE IN. ALREADY THE FIRST OF THE HOLIDAY BEACH-
   GOERS ARE PILING OUT OF THEIR CARS IN A BRIGHTLY COLORED
   CASCADE OF BEACH BALLS, UMBRELLAS, BLANKETS, PORTABLE BAR-B-
   QUES, RADIOS, SUN VISORS, REFLECTORS, RAFTS, BALLS, TUBES,
   AND NEWSPAPERS.

   HOOPER WATCHES ONE SUCH GROUP: A FAMILY OF TEN GETTING OUT
   OF A CAMPER-VAN. HE WATCHES IN DISMAY AS THE FAMILY BUMBLES
   ONTO THE BEACH FOR A DAY OF FUN IN THE SUN.

   BRODY ADDRESSES HIS TROOPS, SUCH AS THEY ARE.

                         BRODY
             I WANT TO THANK YOU GUYS FROM LOCAL
             AGENCIES FOR COOPERATING, AND I HOPE
             WE WON'T ACTUALLY BE NEEDING YOUR
             SERVICES. BUT I'M GLAD TO HAVE YOU
             HERE.

   THE MEN AD LIB RESPONSES: "HAPPY TO DO IT," "ANY TIME,"
   "WHEN'S LUNCH?" "I HATE HOLIDAYS," ETC.

                         ENSIGN
             I WANT TO GET OUR LINES AND REPELLENT
             OUT, SO WE BETTER SHOVE OFF.

   HE NODS TO HIS MEN, WHO HEAD FOR SOME BOSTON WHALERS (OR
   SIMILAR BOAT WITH SURF-RIDING CAPABILITY) AND PUSH OFF INTO
   THE SURF TO PATROL THE SWIMMING AREAS.

                         BRODY
                  (A LAST CAUTION)
             WE'RE ALL ON ONE CHANNEL, SO LET'S
             KEEP RADIO TRAFFIC TO A MINIMUM,
             OKAY?

   EVERYONE KIND OF NODS ACKNOWLEDGMENT.

                         HOOPER
             I HOPE WE GET SOME MORE HELP.

                         BRODY
             I WISH IT WOULD RAIN...

   EXT. BEACH - AMUSEMENT AREA - CLOSE OF SHARK MACHINE

   IN A SHED NEAR THE BANDSTAND, A HALF-DOZEN PINBALL AND ARCADE
   MACHINES SUCKING QUARTERS FROM HOLIDAY BEACH-GOERS. A
   MECHANICAL SHARK TRAVERSES THE SCREEN, IS HIT WITH AN ELECTRIC
   HARPOON AND RED "BLOOD" BLOSSOMS FROM ITS SIDE, INDICATING A
   HIT.

   SOUNDS OF ELECTRONIC GADGETRY, PEOPLE HAVING FUN. MEADOWS IS
   THERE WRITING IT ALL UP FOR THE PAPER. A MOVE AWAY FROM THE
   SCREEN OF THIS PARTICULAR MACHINE REVEALS THE ARCADE, THE
   PARKING LOT, AND, FINALLY, THE BEGINNINGS OF THE PANORAMA OF
   THE BEACH THAT JULY 4TH HAS CREATED.

   EXT. SOUTH BEACH - THE FOURTH OF JULY

   FOUR FOOT SURFER'S SWELL CURLS AND CRASHES ON SHORE,
   RIDERLESS. THE BROAD SANDY BEACH IS A MOSAIC OF SUMMER COLOR
   AS ONE THOUSAND VACATIONERS PRACTICE FUN IN THE SUN, BUT NOT
   IN THE WATER. HOT DOG STANDS AND ICE CREAM VENDORS ARE
   EVERYWHERE.

   ANGLE - LIFEGUARD STATIONS

   A HALF-DOZEN LOOKOUT LOFTS. AS MANY HANDSOME LIFEGUARDS WITH
   WALKIE-TALKIES STRAPPED TO THEIR TRUNKS AND LOUD-HAILERS AT
   ARM'S REACH. BORED, TWO OF THE HOT DOGS TRAIN THEIR BINOCULARS
   ON SOME LOCAL COLOR.

   ANGLE ON TV MOBILE UNIT

   A TV MOBILE UNIT VAN IS SETTING UP: CABLES SNAKING TO CAMERAS,
   A CAMERA WITH A BIG SPORTS ZOOM SITTING ON THE PLATFORM ATOP
   THE TRUCK, A SPIFFY ANNOUNCER-TYPE IN A BLAZER WITH HIS
   STATION'S CALL LETTERS ON THE POCKET. INSIDE THE DARKENED
   CONTROL ROOM, WE CAN SEE THE PALE BLUE SQUARES OF MONITORS
   IN A MOSAIC AGAINST ONE WALL, FACING THE SWITCHER.

   AT SEA

   HOOPER IS METHODICALLY PATROLLING IN HIS BOAT. TACTICALLY
   FLANKING A THREE-HUNDRED-YARD APRON OF BLACK REPELLENT ARE
   FOUR SMALL WATCH-BOATS. A TINY PLEASURE BOAT DARTS AROUND
   THE REPELLENT LINE. FARTHER OUT, CROSSING BACK AND FORTH,
   ARE PATROL BOATS. TO TOP IT ALL OFF, A COAST GUARD HELICOPTER
   HOVERS AND PATROLS THREE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE.

   INT. TELEVISION MOBILE UNIT

   AT LEAST EIGHT MONITORS, REFLECTING THE OUTPUTS OF THREE
   CAMERAS AND TWO TAPE MACHINES, AS WELL AS LINE, PREVIEW, AND
   EFFECTS MONITORS.

   MONITOR: CAMERA 1: HOLDING ON A GROUP OF HAPPY CITIZEN-BATHERS
   AS THEY UNPACK THEIR GEAR, WAVE TO CAMERA, RUN INTO THE WATER.

   MONITOR: CAMERA 2: THE REPELLENT LINE, SET IN PLACE BY COAST
   GUARDSMEN IN SMALL BOATS, SETTING OUT FLOATS, DUMPING
   REPELLENT INTO THE OCEAN.

   MONITOR: CAMERA 3: CLOSE ON THE BANDSTAND, WHERE AMITY'S
   BAND IS PLAYING LILTING PATRIOTIC AIRS.

   AFTER WE'VE SEEN THIS ACTIVITY, WE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S
   GOING ON: THE PREPARATION OF THE TAPE SEGMENT FOR THE SIX
   O'CLOCK NEWS.

                         TV DIRECTOR
             PUT 1 ON THE LINE. IN FIVE. 4. 3. 2.
             1. ROLL.

   ON THE "TAPE 1" AND "LINE" MONITORS, WE SEE VAUGHN BEING
   INTERVIEWED BY THE ANNOUNCER IN THE BLAZER.

                         ANNOUNCER
             ...AND WITH ME IS THE MAYOR OF AMITY,
             LAWRENCE VAUGHN. MR. VAUGHN, HOW
             ABOUT THOSE RUMORS?

                         VAUGHN
             HOW ABOUT THEM INDEED. I'M PLEASED
             AND HAPPY TO REPEAT THE NEWS THAT WE
             HAVE, IN FACT, CAUGHT AND KILLED A
             LARGE PREDATOR THAT SUPPOSEDLY INJURED
             SOME BATHERS HERE. AS YOU CAN SEE,
             IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY, THE BEACHES
             ARE OPEN, AND THE FOLKS HERE ARE
             HAVING A WONDERFUL TIME. AMITY,
             Y'KNOW, MEANS 'FRIENDSHIP.'

   MONITOR: CAMERA 1: AS VAUGHN SPEAKS TO US ON THE MONITORS,
   THE MONITOR FOR CAMERA 1 PANS OVER TO SHOW A SIGHTSEEING BUS
   PULL UP IN THE PARKING AREA, AND A HORDE OF MEDIA VULTURES
   SPILLING OUT, CARRYING CAMERAS WITH LONG LENSES AND TRIPODS,
   TELESCOPES, SUNSHADES AND PARASOLS, ALL THE EQUIPMENT OF THE
   CURIOUS AND NONE OF THE EQUIPMENT OF THE HOLIDAY BATHER OR
   SWIMMER.

   TAPE 1 AND LINE MONITORS: CLOSE ON THE ANNOUNCER, VAUGHN OUT
   OF THE PICTURE.

                         ANNOUNCER
             ALSO HERE TODAY IS A MARINE BIOLOGIST
             AND RESEARCH FELLOW FROM THE
             OCEANOGRAPHIC INSTITUTE, MATTHEW
             HOOPER. MR. HOOPER, WHAT'VE YOU HEARD?

                         HOOPER
             WHAT I'VE HEARD AND WHAT I'VE SEEN
             ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. I BELIEVE
             THERE IS A LARGE GREAT WHITE SHARK --
             CARCHARODON CACHARIAS - IN THE WATERS
             OFF THIS VERY BEACH, THAT HE HAS
             KILLED AND THAT HE WILL KILL AGAIN...

   HOOPER'S VOICE FADES OFF AS SOMEONE AT THE MIXER PANEL DIALS
   HIS MIKE OFF, AND BRINGS UP THE ANNOUNCER'S LAVALIER.

                         ANNOUNCER
                  (MOVING INTO CENTER
                  FRAME)
             AND THERE YOU HAVE IT -- TWO DIFFERENT
             OPINIONS, BY MEN OF GOOD WILL. THE
             HOLIDAY CROWD HERE AT AMITY SEEMS TO
             BE MAKING UP ITS OWN MIND...

   THE CAMERA PANS OFF HIM TO A HAPPY FAMILY HEADED FOR THE
   BEACH.

   MONITOR: CAMERA 3: ZOOMS IN ON THE PUFFING FACE OF THE TUBA
   PLAYER.

   MONITOR: CAMERA 2: BRODY AND THE ANNOUNCER.

   MONITOR: TAPE 1 AND LINE: BACK ON THE ANNOUNCER, HIS LIPS
   MOVING, BUT HIS SOUND TURNED OFF. WE HEAR, INSTEAD, THE SOUND
   FROM MONITOR CAMERA 2, BRODY AND THE SAME ANNOUNCER.

                         BRODY
             I'M SORRY, I JUST DON'T HAVE THE
             TIME.

                         TV DIRECTOR
             RECUE THE MACHINES. 2, PAN OFF THE
             CHIEF AND SHOW ME SOME TITS AND ASS.
             1, GET ME SOME CUTE KIDS. 3... SEE
             IF YOU GOT A SHOT AT THE WATER.

   MONITORS: CAMERAS 1, 2 AND 3: THE CAMERAS SEEK OUT THE
   APPROPRIATE ACTIVITY AS THE DIRECTOR CALLS FOR IT.

                         ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
                  (HOLDS UP STOPWATCH)
             MAYOR, 43 SECONDS, BIOLOGIST 45
             SECONDS. THAT'S EQUAL TIME, RIGHT?

                         DIRECTOR
             RIGHT.
                  (HE PRESSES "TALKBACK"
                  BUTTON TO HIS
                  ANNOUNCER)
             JERRY, COME ON IN AND LOOK AT THIS.
                  (TO HIS HEADSET)
             ROLL 2. IN FIVE, 4. 3. 2. 1.

   TAPE 2 - MONITOR:

   STARTS SHOWING US THE ASSEMBLED INTERVIEW SEGMENT WE'VE JUST
   SEEN, STARTING WITH THE ANNOUNCER'S OPENING REMARKS.

                         ANNOUNCER (V.O. MONITOR)
             AMITY ISLAND IS FAMED FOR ITS CLEAR
             AIR AND WHITE SAND BEACHES. BUT A
             CLOUD APPEARED...

   HIS VOICE IS DIALED UNDER AS THE ANNOUNCER HIMSELF APPEARS
   IN THE CONTROL ROOM TO WATCH HIMSELF ON THE MONITORS.

                         ANNOUNCER (LIVE)
             LOOK AT THAT SHINE ON MY NOSE. IT'S
             A BEACON.

                         DIRECTOR
             CLOSE ENOUGH FOR REMOTE.

   AS VAUGHN BEGINS HIS SPIEL AGAIN, THE OTHER MONITORS SHOW US
   THE ACTION ON THE BEACH.

                         VAUGHN (V.O.)
             ...I'M PLEASED AND HAPPY...

                         DIRECTOR
             THINK WE OUGHT TO STICK AROUND?

                         ANNOUNCER
             WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

                         ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
             TEACHERS' STRIKE DOWNTOWN.

                         CAMERAMAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
             CHRISTENSON, THIS IS AL. UNION SAYS
             TIME FOR ENGINEERING FIVE.

                         DIRECTOR
             THAT'S FIVE MINUTES, GUYS. COFFEE.

   ANGLE ON THE BEACH

   VAUGHN IS IN HIS SHIRTSLEEVES, HAVING SLIPPED OUT OF HIS
   JACKET.

   HE MOPS HIS BROW, AND SURVEYS THE BEACHFRONT. AT THIS MOMENT,
   THERE'S NOBODY SWIMMING. HE APPROACHES A FAMILIAR SELECTMAN,
   NODS HELLO, AND SQUATS BESIDE HIM ON THE SAND.

                         VAUGHN
             WHY DON'T YOU GET IN THE WATER?

                         SELECTMAN
             I DON'T WANT TO WASH OFF MY SUNTAN
             LOTION. I'LL GET A BURN...

                         VAUGHN
                  (SOME URGENCY)
             NOBODY'S GOING IN!

   ON AN ADJOINING BLANKET, A SPIRITED RUTH GORDON TYPE IS
   SITTING, WATCHING BRIGHTLY AS HER MANSERVANT, A POLISHED
   ERIC HARRISON TYPE, PREPARES SOME TEA FROM A THERMOS.

                         WOMAN
             IS THERE NOBODY GOING IN? WHAT A
             SHAME. ARTHUR, SHOULD I BE GOING IN?

                         ARTHUR (THE BUTLER)
                  (POURING TEA)
             IF YOU'D LIKE.

   HE PUTS DOWN THE TEA SERVICE, AND LEADS HER TOWARDS THE WATER.

   AT THE EDGE OF THE SEA, SHE STOPS, AND HE WALKS IN.

                         ARTHUR
                  (AS HE ENTERS THE
                  WAVES)
             IT'S VERY NICE. NOT TOO COLD... QUITE
             REFRESHING... VERY PLEASANT....

   HE DUCKS HIS HEAD UNDER FOR A FINAL LOOK AROUND. HIS DRIPPING
   HEAD RISES TRIUMPHANTLY FROM THE SURF.

                         ARTHUR
             NO SHARKS, M'LADY.

   SHE STARTS INTO THE WATER, HE TAKES HER PARASOL, ESCORTING
   HER THE REST OF THE WAY INTO THE OCEAN.

                         WOMAN
             THIS IS MARVELOUS! ARTHUR, I WANT TO
             COME BACK TO THIS VERY SPOT. WILL
             YOU MAKE A NOTE OF WHERE WE ARE?

   WIDE - ON THE BEACH

   ENCOURAGED BY THE SIGHT OF THE WOMAN AND ARTHUR, AND VAUGHN'S
   QUIET URGINGS, PEOPLE BEGIN TO WANDER INTO THE SURF, A FEW
   AT FIRST, AND THEN A RUSH, AS PEOPLE PLUNGE IN AND BEGIN
   ENJOYING THE PLEASURES OF OCEAN BATHING. THE SELECTMAN GOES
   IN, HIS FAMILY FOLLOWS, VAUGHN WATCHES IT ALL, BEAMING.

   BOAT #7

   HENDRICKS IS ON THE RADIO WHILE A COAST GUARD SPOTTER WORKS

   ANGLE - BEACH - CLOSE ON BRODY

   HE IS WALKING DOWN THE BEACH, THREADING HIS WAY THROUGH THE
   HAPPY HORDES. MEADOWS NODS "HELLO."

                         VOICES
             WHO'S SCARED TO GO IN! I WAS IN! UP
             TO YOUR KNEES, YEAH -- SO COME WITH

                         MEADOWS
             BEAUTIFUL DAY, CHIEF!

   A GROUP OF YOUNGSTERS PLAYING WITH MICHAEL BRODY'S DINGHY.

   THEY ARE HAULING IT TOWARD THE SURF.

                         BRODY
             HEY MIKEY -- !

   MICHAEL TURNS AS BRODY TROTS TOWARD HIM.

                         BRODY
             YOU'RE NOT GOING TO THE OCEAN WITH
             THAT, ARE YOU SON?

                         MICHAEL
             I'M ALL CHECKED OUT FOR LIGHT SURF
             AND LOOK AT IT.

                         BRODY
             DO ME THIS FAVOR JUST ONCE. USE THE
             PONDS.

                         MICHAEL
             DAD, THE PONDS ARE FOR OLD LADIES.

                         BRODY

                         MICHAEL
                  (CONFUSED)
             SURE, DAD.

   TV CREW - NEAR WATER

   TV CAMERAMEN ARE PACKING UP THEIR GEAR. FOR THEM IT'S A WRAP

   REPELLENT LINE - COUNTY POLICEMAN

   SUDDENLY HIS WALKIE-TALKIE FIZZES, AND THE COPTER SPOTTER'S
   VOICE OVERLOADS THE SPEAKER.

                         COPTER SPOTTER
             COPTER TO DAISY! RED FOUR, RED FOUR!

   BOAT #7 - HENDRICKS

             WENT UNDER YOUR -- THERE!

   THE COAST GUARD SONAR OPERATOR SPOTS IT AND PALES. A SLICK
   BLACK DORSAL FIN IS SLICING A WAKE TOWARD THE SWIMMING AREA.

                         SONAR OPERATOR
             JESUS CHRIST -- SHARK!

   BEACH - BRODY

   RIGID AND CHOKED, HE ALMOST BREAKS THE "SEND" BUTTON TRYING
   TO TRANSMIT.

                         BRODY
             EVERYBODY OUT! OUT OF THE WATER,
             PLEASE -- LEAVE THE WATER, PLEASE --

   A LIFEGUARD IN A LOFT BEHIND HIM BEGINS BLOWING ON HIS
   WHISTLE.

   CLOSE - BRODY

   SHOUTING HYSTERICALLY.

                         BRODY
             NO WHISTLES! NO WHISTLES!

   THE BEACH

   DOZENS OF BATHERS HALFWAY OUT OF THE WATER, TURN TO SEE.
   MORE WHISTLES, AND THEY START TOWARD SHORE. WE HEAR PANICKY
   VOICES AD-LIBBING; "SHARK," "LOOK OUT," ETC. THE LOUDHAILERS
   SOUNDING MORE URGENT NOW, AND A CONTAGIOUS DREAD SEIZES ONE
   PERSON AFTER ANOTHER. ENTIRE GROUPS OF PEOPLE BEGIN PULLING
   TOWARD SHORE, SOME OF THEM OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO CONTROL A
   GROWING HYSTERIA IN OTHERS.

   BOATS #6 AND #7

   ARE CONVERGING, HEADING TOWARD THE REPELLENT LINE AS IF
   TRACKING AN UNDERWATER SHADOW. THE FIN IS BEYOND THE REPELLENT
   CORDONS AND HEADING INTO THE CROWDS.

   HOOPER'S BOAT

   CAUGHT ON THE OTHER END OF THE LINE, HE IS WHEELING IN A
   BROAD, HOT-DOGGER'S CIRCLE TURN, HEADED BACK.

   THE WATER - BATHERS

   PEOPLE BEGIN SCREAMING. KIDS ARE SUDDENLY SEPARATED FROM
   THEIR PARENTS. OTHERS SEEM TO FORGET HOW TO SWIM. ONE MYOPIC
   LITTLE GIRL HAS HER GLASSES BUMPED OFF AND SHE BEGINS TO CRY
   IN BLINDED PANIC. ELLEN BRODY LOOKS AROUND FRANTIC.

   BOATS #2, #3, #4

   THE RIFLEMEN IN THE BOATS ARE TRYING TO GET A BEAD, BUT TOO
   MANY CIVILIANS CREATE A HAZARD. THE COAST GUARDSMEN ATTEMPT
   TO SEVER THE REPELLENT CORD TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE BATHING
   AREA AND THE HEAVING FIN.

   THE WATER - BATHERS

   THIS IS A CONFIRMATION OF OUR WORST DREAD -- A FULL-BLOWN
   HEADLONG WATER PANIC. SCREAMING VACATIONERS CLAW THEIR WAY
   OVER THE BODIES OF THE LESS ABLE. SOME LITERALLY ATTEMPT TO
   WALK OVER THE BOBBING HEADS AND GLISTENING BACKS OF OTHERS
   PULLING FOR DRY LAND.

   CLOSEUPS - PANIC

   HORRIFIED FACES. SOME ARE STUNNED AND WANDERING IN SLOW,
   TENTATIVE CIRCLES, WHILE OTHERS ARE HELPED OUT BY FRIENDS.

   FIVE PEOPLE TRY TO MOUNT A RUBBER RAFT.

   UGLY REMINDERS THAT EACH OF US IS NUMBER ONE.

   BRODY ENTERS SHOT, YELLING INTO HIS WALKIE-TALKIE, SOMEONE
   CHARGES PAST HIM TO HELP AN OLD MAN OUT OF THE WATER.

   EXT. THE BEACH

   DRAGGING THE HELPLESS FROM THE SURF. TEARS WELL IN BRODY'S
   EYES. THE SCREAMING IS DEAFENING. THE TV UNIT IS HOPPING UP
   AND DOWN IN RAGE AND FRUSTRATION.

                         TV DIRECTOR
             WHY DID WE WRAP? GET THAT! SOMEBODY
             GET THAT!

   ONE THOUSAND SURVIVORS PACK THE BEACH, STANDING ABSOLUTELY
   STILL. A NUMBING COLD SETS IN, AND PEOPLE SHIVER AGAINST
   EACH OTHER.

   MUTED SOBS, WHIMPERING, COUGHING.

   THE SIX BURLY LIFEGUARDS HUDDLE TOGETHER LIKE CUB SCOUTS.

   ANGLE - BATHING AREA

   THE MONSTROUS BLACK FIN TURNS A SLOW CIRCLE AS TWO COAST
   GUARDSMEN MANAGE TO CUT THEIR OWN REPELLENT LINE. ALL BOATS
   CONVERGE ON THE DYNAMIC FIN. MEN RAISE THEIR GUNS TO FIRE.
   OTHERS ADLIB NAUTICAL COMMANDS IN A UNIQUELY CALCULATED
   FASHION.

   CLOSE - FIN

   IT SLIPS SIDEWAYS, REVEALING FOR THE FIRST TIME A TINY BLUE
   SNORKEL. THEN APPEARS THE FACES OF TWO YOUNGSTERS WHOM WE
   WILL RECALL FROM THE COVEN BEHIND THE DUNE. THE FIN BOBS
   BACK, A BEAVERBOARD REPLICA ATTACHED TO A PARTIALLY SUBMERGED
   SURFBOARD. ONE YOUNGSTER LOOKS UP AND IS GREETED BY:

   YOUNGSTER'S POINT OF VIEW

   TWENTY RIFLES AND SHOTGUNS POINTED DIRECTLY AT HIM.
   SURROUNDING HIM ON THREE SIDES. SOME OF THE POLICEMEN START
   TO LOWER THEIR GUNS -- STRUCK DUMB.

   HOOPER IN HIS BOAT

   HE THROTTLES BACK SUDDENLY, SUBSIDING INTO HIS OWN WAKE, HIS
   EYES STILL RESTLESSLY SEARCHING.

   CLOSE - YOUNGSTER

   HIS ONLY DEFENSE, HE BEGINS TO CRY -- AND FEEBLY RAISES HIS
   HANDS IN UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER.

   ANGLE - ESTUARY

   THE NARROW ESTUARY LEADING INTO THE HALF-MILE IS ROUGH TODAY.

   TWO CHILDREN DIGGING IN THE SAND AND UNAWARE OF THE BEACH
   PANIC ONE HUNDRED YARDS AWAY LOOK UP, AND THE LITTLE GIRL
   POINTS.

   BLACK DORSAL FIN

   IS CRUISING THROUGH THE NARROWS AND TOWARD THE BUSY POND.

   HOOPER IN HIS BOAT AGAIN

   HE SEES IT, AND JAMS HIS THROTTLE FORWARD. HE STEERS WITH
   ONE HAND, FUMBLING URGENTLY FOR HIS WALKIE-TALKIE WITH THE
   OTHER.

   AERIAL VIEW

   THE CIRCLE OF BOATS AROUND THE LITTLE PRANKSTERS, THE CROWDS
   HUDDLED ON THE BEACH, HOOPER'S BOAT SUDDENLY ARROWING TOWARDS
   THE ESTUARY, LEAVING A HUGE BOILING WAKE.

   CLOSE ON VAUGHN

   HE CATCHES HOOPER'S BOAT OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS EYE.
   CURIOUS, HE FOLLOWS ITS PROGRESS. IT'S URGENCY FINALLY
   COMMUNICATES ITSELF TO VAUGHN, WHO BEGINS A SHAMBLING TROT
   ACROSS THE DUNES TOWARDS A RISE OVERLOOKING THE ESTUARY.

   OVERLOOKING THE ESTUARY

   VAUGHN GETS THERE JUST IN TIME TO SEE THE DISASTER. HE
   WATCHES, HELPLESS, TRYING TO SHOUT, OUT OF BREATH. STUNNED.

   ANGLE - POND

   MICHAEL IS TACKING FULL-SAIL IN HIS BOAT WITH A FRIEND, KIT.

   KIT IS ADMIRING THE SHARK'S TOOTH NECKLACE AROUND HIS OWN
   NECK WHILE MICHAEL RUBS SOME WATER ON THE SCRATCHES LEFT BY
   IT.

   THE FIN, HUGE, BLACK AND REAL, CROSSES BEHIND THEM. THEY ARE
   NOT YET AWARE. THE FIN SEEMS TO CIRCLE AND RETURN. IT HEADS
   TOWARD MICHAEL'S BOAT WHEN ANOTHER SMALL DINGHY GETS IN ITS
   WAY -- A WEEKEND NOVICE JUST FINISHING A THERMOS OF COFFEE
   WHEN HE IS "BUMPED." THE ENTIRE BOAT IS OVERTURNED. MICHAEL
   SEES THE FIN NOW AS IT COLLIDES WITH HIM, THE ENTIRE BOW
   LIFTING OUT OF THE WATER AND ROLLING OVER ON THE PORT SIDE.

   MICHAEL AND KIT ARE THROWN HEAD FIRST.

   THREE HEADS IN THE WATER COME UP SPUTTERING, THE FIN BETWEEN
   THEM CROSSING BACK. MICHAEL FREEZES. THE FIN COMES DIRECTLY
   AT HIM, GROWING INTO THE SKY, PASSING HIM SO CLOSE HE COULD
   TOUCH IT, BUT IGNORING HIM AS IT FOLLOWS THE FLAILING AND
   PANICKED WEEKEND NOVICE. CATCHES HIM. MICHAEL WATCHES. THAT
   ALL TOO FAMILIAR EXPLOSION OF WATER -- A CHOKED OFF SCREAM --
   THE HEAD AND UPPER TORSO OF THE NOVICE PASSING MICHAEL SWIFTLY
   AS THOUGH BEING CARRIED OFF -- A CURRENT OF BLOOD TRAILING
   BEHIND.

                         THE VICTIM
                  (PASSING A HORRIFIED
                  MICHAEL, WHO HALF
                  EXTENDS ONE HAND, AS
                  IF TO HELP)
             IT'S NO GOOD. I'M DEAD...
                  (AND HE IS)

   A RENEWED CRY OF SHARK!

   CLOSE - BRODY

   HE TURNS. OH GOD! RUNNING THROUGH THE SLOGGING SAND.

   CLOSE - ELLEN

   A SUDDEN TURN. SHE RUNS.

   CLOSE - HOOPER IN BOAT

   HE'S GOT THE WALKIE-TALKIE TO HIS MOUTH.

                         HOOPER
             BLOCK THE ESTUARY! THE ESTUARY!

   THREE BOATS RACING TO CARRY OUT THE ORDERS. THE BLACK FIN RE-
   PASSING THE TWO CHILDREN, RACING TO GET OUT. HOOPER REACHES
   THE MOUTH BEFORE THE OTHERS. THE FIN WON'T VEER OFF. IT SMACKS
   INTO THE LITTLE VESSEL, BUMPING IT ASIDE. THE FIN IS LEFT
   RACING INTO OPEN WATER. BLOOD LEAVINGS. HOOPER LEAPING OVER
   THE SIDE, SLOGGING TOWARDS MICHAEL.

   WIDE ON WATER

   COPTER ROARS IN BUZZING THE SHARK, BUT TOO LATE.

   CLOSE - BRODY AND ELLEN

   THEY ARE PULLING MICHAEL OUT OF THE WATER AS HOOPER SPLASHES
   UP. MICHAEL IS CONSCIOUS BUT IN SHOCK -- HIS EYES STARING AT
   NOTHING.

                         BRODY
                  (FEELING HIS FACE)
             HE'S IN SHOCK. GET BLANKETS!

   PEOPLE GATHER AND BRODY SNATCHES BEACH TOWELS OUT OF THEIR
   HANDS. THEY COVER MICHAEL AND CARRY HIM OFF THE BEACH, FEET
   RAISED ABOVE HIS HEAD.

   INT. HOSPITAL - DAY

   MICHAEL IS WHEELED OUT IN THE BED. BRODY AND ELLEN ARE THERE.

   SEAN IS SLEEPY IN BRODY'S ARMS. VAUGHN IS WAITING IN THE
   HALL.

                         NURSE
             THE DOCTOR SAID IT'S OKAY -- MILD
             SHOCK. HE CAN COME HOME IN THE
             MORNING.

                         ELLEN
                  (TO MICHAEL)
             HEY, BIG GUY -- YOU WANT ANYTHING
             FROM HOME?

                         MICHAEL
             MY CARS. AND A COMIC BOOK.

                         BRODY
                  (SEES VAUGHN)
             HERE --
                  (GIVES BABY TO ELLEN)
             TAKE HIM HOME.

                         ELLEN
             HOME... NEW YORK?

                         BRODY
             NO. HOME HERE.

   ELLEN EXITS.

                         BRODY
                  (CROSSING TO VAUGHN)
             GOT A PEN ON YOU?

                         VAUGHN
             WHY?

                         BRODY
             THERE'S ONLY ONE THING YOU'RE GOOD
             FOR ANYMORE -- SIGNING A DAMN VOUCHER.
             HERE. IT'S AN AUTHORIZATION TO EMPLOY
             A CONTRACTOR.

                         VAUGHN
             I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DO THAT WITHOUT
             A...

                         BRODY
                  (INTERRUPTING)
             I'M GOING TO HIRE QUINT TO KILL THE
             FISH. I WANT TO SEE THAT SHARK DEAD.

                         VAUGHN
             MAYBE WE CAN SAVE AUGUST...

                         BRODY
             FORGET IT. THIS SUMMER'S HAD IT.
             NEXT SUMMER'S HAD IT. YOU'RE THE
             MAYOR OF SHARK CITY. YOU WANTED TO
             KEEP THE BEACHES OPEN. WHAT HAPPENS
             WHEN THE TOWN FINDS OUT ABOUT THAT?

                         VAUGHN
             I WAS ACTING IN THE TOWN'S BEST
             INTERESTS...

                         BRODY
             THE BEST INTEREST IN THIS TOWN WOULD
             BE TO SEE THAT FISH BELLY-UP IN THE
             WATER WITH A HOLE IN HIS HEAD. YOU
             DO THE RIGHT THING. YOU AUTHORIZE
             ME.
                  (INDICATES PAPER)
             RIGHT THERE. WHATEVER IT COSTS.

                         VAUGHN
             MY KIDS WERE ON THAT BEACH...

                         BRODY
             JUST SIGN IT, LARRY.

   VAUGHN SIGNS, AND BRODY TAKES THE PAPER AND EXITS.

   QUINT'S HOUSE - DAY

   BRODY AND HOOPER ARE APPROACHING QUINT'S HOUSE. THEY ENTER
   THROUGH THE BIG WOODEN DOORS, INTO ANOTHER CIRCLE OF HELL.

   SMOKE AND STEAM FROM TWO BIG OIL DRUMS SITTING OVER FIRES
   FILLS THE AIR. QUINT AND HIS MATE, HERSCHEL, ARE GRINDING
   PIECES OF PILOT WHALE INTO CHUM. THE WHALE LIES BLOODY ON
   THE FLOOR, ITS RUINED CARCASS ADDING TO THE STENCH OF OTHER
   SHARKS BEING BOILED IN THE DRUMS, THEIR TAILS SUSPENDED IN
   THE AIR.

   DIESEL FUMES AND DECAY FILL THE AIR, AND TOOLS, ROPES, BROKEN
   BITS OF IRON AND ENGINE PARTS LITTER THE FLOOR. WALL HANGINGS
   OF ROPE AND FLOATS, AND BUOYS, BARRELS, TACKLE AND GEAR ALL
   CONSPIRE TO FRAME THE KILLING FLOOR.

   BRODY AND HOOPER NAVIGATE THE OBSTACLE COURSE.

                         BRODY
             THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE BIG
             VIOLATION...

                         HOOPER
                  (HANDLING SOME GEAR)
             THIS IS QUITE A PLACE.

                         QUINT'S VOICE
             KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF MY STUFF.

   HE EMERGES FROM THE STEAM AND SMOKE.

                         QUINT
             DID YOU BRING A CHECK?

                         BRODY
             WHAT?

                         QUINT
             CASH? OR DO WE DO THIS ON A HANDSHAKE
             AND A PROMISE?

                         BRODY
             I'M AUTHORIZED BY THE TOWNSHIP OF
             AMITY TO HIRE YOU AS AN INDEPENDENT
             CONTRACTOR. WE'LL MEET YOUR PRICE.

             YOU GOT IT.

                         QUINT
             AND INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IF ANY...

                         BRODY
             YOU GOT IT.

                         QUINT
             AND YOU GET THE MAYOR OFF MY BACK
             WITH THIS ZONING CRAP. NOBODY TELLS
             ME HOW TO RUN MY PROPERTY.

                         BRODY
             YOU GOT IT.

                         QUINT
             AND, UH, A CASE OF APRICOT BRANDY
             AND YOU BUY THE LUNCH.

                         BRODY
             TWO CASES. AND DINNER WHEN YOU LAND.

                  (POURS DRINK)
             TRY SOME OF THIS. I MADE IT MYSELF.

   BRODY TASTES.

             HERE'S TO SWIMMIN' WITH BOWLEGGED
             WOMEN.

   HERSCHEL INTERRUPTS. HE'S STOPPED WORKING, AND IS WIPING HIS
   HANDS ON A BLOODY RAG.

                         HERSCHEL
             MR. QUINT...

   QUINT WHEELS TO FACE HIM.

                         HERSCHEL
             I'M NOT GOIN'. NO SIR.

                         QUINT
             YOU WANT TO GET PAID, YOU GO.

                         HERSCHEL
             FORGET THE MONEY. YOU CAN'T PAY ME
             ENOUGH. I AIN'T CRAZY. I WORKED SOME
             BIG MEAN FISH WITH YOU, BUT I AIN'T
             GOIN' ON THIS ONE.

                         QUINT
             THIS IS THE LAST TIME I HEAR FROM
             YOU. I DON'T WANT ANYONE WITH PISS
             FOR BLOOD ON MY VESSEL. PUT THAT
             BLACKFISH ON BOARD, PUMP THE BILGES,
             AND TOP OFF THE FUEL TANKS, AND FINISH
             UP IN THE MORNING. THEN YOU'RE ON
             THE BEACH.

                         HOOPER
             YOU'RE GOING TO NEED AN EXTRA HAND...

   QUINT TURNS TO SEE THIS NEW VOICE, AND STARTS WALKING TOWARDS
   HIM.

                         BRODY
             THIS IS MATT HOOPER...

                         QUINT
             I KNOW WHO HE IS...

                         BRODY
             HE'S FROM THE OCEANOGRAPHIC INSTITUTE.

                         HOOPER
             I'VE BEEN TO SEA SINCE I WAS 12.

                         QUINT
             I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT DAY SAILING OR
             PLEASURE BOATING. I'M TALKING ABOUT
             WORKING FOR A LIVING. SHARKING.

                         HOOPER
             AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT HOOKING
             SOME POOR DOGFISH OR SAND SHARK. I'M
             TALKING ABOUT A GREAT WHITE.

                         QUINT
             ARE YOU NOW. I KNOW ABOUT PORKERS IN
             THE WATER --
                  (THROWS HIM SOME ROPE)
             HERE. TIE ME A SHEEPSHANK.

   HOOPER TIES THE KNOT EFFORTLESSLY.

                         HOOPER
             I DON'T NEED TO PASS BASIC SEAMANSHIP.

                         QUINT
             LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS...

   HE TAKES HOOPER'S HANDS IN HIS OWN BIG BLOODY FISTS, AND
   FEELS THEM AS HE TALKS.

                         QUINT
             HA. CITY HANDS. YOU BEEN COUNTING
             MONEY. IF YOU HAD A $5000 NET AND
             $2000 WORTH OF FISH IN IT, AND ALONG
             COMES MR. WHITE, AND MAKES IT LOOK
             LIKE A KIDDY SCISSORS CLASS HAS GONE
             TO WORK ON IT AND MADE PAPER DOLLS.
             IF YOU'D EVER WORKED FOR A LIVING,
             YOU'D KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

                         HOOPER
             LOOK, I DON'T NEED TO HEAR ANY OF
             THIS WORKING CLASS HERO CRAP. SOME
             PARTY BOAT SKIPPER WHO'S KILLED A
             FEW SHARKS...

                         BRODY
                  (INTERRUPTING)
             HEY. KNOCK IT OFF. I DON'T WANT TO
             HAVE TO LISTEN TO THIS WHILE WE'RE
             OUT THERE...

                         QUINT
             WHAT DO YOU MEAN 'WE...?'

                         BRODY
             IT'S MY CHARTER. MY PARTY.

                         QUINT
             ALL RIGHT, COMMISSIONER. BUT WHEN
             WE'RE ON MY SHIP, I AM MASTER, MATE
             AND PILOT. AND I WANT HIM...
                  (INDICATES HOOPER)
             ...ALONG FOR BALLAST.

                         BRODY
             YOU GOT IT.

   EXT. QUINT'S DOCK - MORNING

   THE MATE IS LOADING. HE HANDS QUINT THE ITEMS ON HIS CHECK

   AS HE TALKS, WE SEE HOOPER COMING DOWN TO THE DOCK. WHEELING
   A WAGON BEHIND HIM ARE TWO LONG-HAIRED RESEARCH ASSISTANTS
   FROM THE INSTITUTE. ON THE WAGON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IS A
   BIG SHARK CAGE. AT DOCKSIDE, HOOPER CHECKS HIS LIST, AS HE

             ALL OF IT. AND THANK DR. MIRO FOR
             ME. AND TELL BORACK I'LL CATCH UP
             WITH THEM IN NEW ZEALAND.

                         ASSISTANT
             THIS IS ACTUALLY A KILLING EXPEDITION?

                         QUINT
             HEY, SQUIRT! YOU WANT TO STOW THIS
             GEAR OR YOU WANT ME TO USE IT FOR
             BALLAST? IT AIN'T GOOD FOR MUCH BUT
             BAIT.

             I'LL SEE YA. TELL DOROTHY HELLO.

   HOOPER SEES HIS GEAR APPROACHING.

   ANGLE ON DOCK AND ORCA

   QUINT SEES HOOPER APPROACHING WITH THE LARGE CAGE.

                         QUINT
             HELLO, JUNIOR. WHAT ARE YOU? SOME
             KIND OF HALF-ASSED ASTRONAUT?
                  (TO HIMSELF)
             JESUS CHRIST, WHEN I WAS A KID, EVERY
             LITTLE SQUIRT WANTED TO BE A HARPOONER
             OR A SWORD FISHERMAN. WHAT D'YA HAVE
             THERE -- A PORTABLE SHOWER?

                         HOOPER
             ANTI-SHARK CAGE.

                         QUINT
             WHO'S INSIDE, YOU OR THE SHARK?

   HOOPER INDICATES "ME."

                         QUINT
             YOU'RE IN THE CAGE?
                  (HOOPER NODS)
             THE CAGE IS IN THE WATER?

             THE SHARK IS IN THE WATER TOO?
                  (HOOPER NODS)
             YOU'RE IN THE WATER WITH THE SHARK.

   HOOPER NODS. QUINT SINGS "SPANISH LADIES" HALF TO HIMSELF.

             COMIN' ABOARD...

   ANGLE ON DOCK, BRODY AND ELLEN APPROACHING

   SHE'S CARRYING A LITTLE PLASTIC SHOPPING BAG, HE'S WEARING
   SHINY NEW FOUL WEATHER GEAR, BUNDLED UP, SWEATY,
   UNCOMFORTABLE.

   SHE GIVES HIM AS GOOD A HUG AS SHE CAN MANAGE UNDER THE
   CIRCUMSTANCES.

                         ELLEN
             DID YOU TAKE YOUR DRAMAMINE?
                  (BRODY NODS)
             HERE.

   SHE STRAIGHTENS HIS COAT, AND GIVES HIM A SHAVING KIT TO
   CARRY ABOARD WITH HIS TOILETRIES. FROM THE DECK, QUINT
   WHISTLES DERISIVELY.

                         QUINT
             HURRY UP, CHIEF, DAYLIGHT'S A WASTIN'.

                         ELLEN
             IS THAT HIM?

                         BRODY
                  (TO ELLEN)
             COLORFUL, ISN'T HE?

                         ELLEN
             YOU GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT?

                         BRODY
             NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT -- I'LL SURVIVE
             THIS.

                         ELLEN
             I'LL SEE YOU BACK SOON. THERE'S AN
             EXTRA PAIR OF GLASSES IN YOUR BLACK
             SOCKS, AND THERE'S SOME SUNTAN LOTION
             AND BLISTEX IN YOUR KIT.

   BRODY NODS, AND HOLDS HER HAND FOR A WORDLESS MOMENT.

                         QUINT (O.S.)
                  (SINGS)
             'HERE IS THE BODY OF MARY LEE. FOR
             15 YEARS SHE KEPT HER VIRGINITY. NOT
             A BAD RECORD FOR THIS VICINITY.'

   THERE IS A SPUTTER AND ROAR AS THE ORCA'S DIESELS KICK ON.

                         BRODY
             YO-HO-HO AND A BOTTLE OF RUM.

                         ELLEN
                  (HUGGING HIM)
             WHAT'LL I TELL THE KIDS?

                         BRODY
             TELL 'EM I WENT FISHIN'!

   THEY LAUGH TOGETHER, AND EXCHANGE A SHORT, FIERCE KISS.

                         QUINT
             CAST OFF THE BOW LINE! NOW YOUR STERN!

   ITS DIESELS CHUGGING, THE ORCA PULLS AWAY FROM THE PIER.

   ELLEN HAS ALREADY RESOLUTELY TURNED HER BACK ON IT, AND IS
   WALKING OFF THE DOCK BACK ONTO DRY LAND.

   ABOARD THE ORCA

   QUINT HAS SET A COURSE OUT TOWARDS THE OPEN SEA. HE LASHES
   THE WHEEL, AND JUMPS DOWN TO ADDRESS HOOPER AND BRODY, WHO
   ARE STANDING TOGETHER IN THE STERN.

                         QUINT
                  (TO BRODY)
             FRONT-BOW, BACK-STERN, PORT,
             STARBOARD. ALOFT, BELOW. IT'S NOT A
             STAIRCASE, IT'S A LADDER, IT'S NOT A
             ROPE, IT'S A LINE, AND IF YOU DON'T
             GET IT RIGHT...
                  (INDICATES PORTHOLE)
             I'LL THROW YOUR ASS THROUGH THAT
             LITTLE ROUND WINDOW.

   HE LAUGHS AT HIS JOKE. THIS IS PROBABLY SOMETHING HE TELLS
   ALL HIS CHARTERS.

                         QUINT
             NOW HEAR THIS. YOU'RE ABOARD THE
             FISHING VESSEL 'ORCA,' AND I'M HER
             CAPTAIN, MASTER, MATE, AND OWNER.
             YOU'LL JUMP WHEN I HOLLER. WE'RE
             DOIN' A JOB HERE, AND CHRIST, I AIN'T
             GOT TIME TO WATCH YOU BIRDS GET HOOKS
             IN YOUR ASS AND FALL OVERBOARD. SHIP
             WITH ME, AND YOU'LL DO ALL RIGHT.
             CROSS ME, AND I'LL SLAP YOU UPSIDE
             YOUR HEADS. NOW -- IF YOU BOYS ARE
             READY -- LET'S GO FISHIN'.

   HE STARTS MOVING GEAR AROUND, PREPARING CHUM BARRELS, SETTING
   HOOKS, HOOPER GIVES HIM A HAND, BRODY STAYS OUT OF THE WAY.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

   EXT. THE OCEAN - NOON

   IT IS QUIET AS THE ORCA DRIFTS ALONG IN THE CURRENT, A WIDE
   CHUM SLICK SPREADING BEHIND IT. A COUPLE OF FLAG BUOYS SPREAD
   ALONG OUR PERSPECTIVE SHOW US THE MILES THE BOAT HAS GONE.

   QUINT SPOTS SOMETHING IN THE WATER -- A SMALL BLUE SHARK
   ATTRACTED BY THE CHUM. HE RIGS A SMALL POLE WITH A PIECE OF
   BAIT, AND THROWS IT OVER THE SIDE.

                         QUINT
             HERE'S SOMETHING FOR YOU...

   THE SHARK TAKES THE BAIT, QUINT BRUTALLY AND EFFICIENTLY
   SETS THE HOOK, AND REELS THE SHARK ALONGSIDE. HE HAULS IT
   PART WAY OUT OF THE WATER, AND STICKS IT WITH A GAFF. HOOPER
   AND BRODY WATCH.

   INSERT - SHARK WRIGGLING ON HOOK

   TAILROPE DROPPING ON HIM. GAFFED AND BLEEDING, THE SHARK IS
   IMMOBILIZED BY QUINT'S PRACTICED HANDS. HE TAKES ONE OF HIS
   BIG KNIVES AND POSES FOR A MOMENT BESIDE THE STRUGGLING FISH.

                         QUINT
             THESE GREEDY SONS-A-BITCHES WILL EAT
             THEIR OWN GUTS.

   HE SLICES INTO THE SHARK'S UNDERBELLY. WE HEAR THE SOUND OF
   ENTRAILS PLOPPING INTO THE WATER. BRODY IS ALMOST RETCHING,
   AND HOOPER IS JUST DISPLEASED.

   ANGLE ON THE WATER

   THE GUTTED SHARK SWIMMING IN CIRCLES BITING AT ITS OWN
   ENTRAILS.

   ANOTHER ANGLE

   FINS CLOSING IN ON THE WOUNDED SHARK.

                         QUINT
             GO AHEAD, YOU CANNIBALS. TELL 'EM
             WHERE YOU GOT IT!

   SHARK FRENZY

   A BOIL OF WATER AND THE FLASH OF FINS AND TEETH AS THE LOCAL
   SHARKS ERUPT IN A FEEDING FRENZY, JAWS SNAPPING, BLOOD
   SPEWING, A SUDDEN DISPLAY OF THE FURY AND BLIND PREDATORY
   DRIVE OF THE FEARSOME SPECIES.

                         HOOPER
             WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO PROVE?

                         QUINT
             JUST A LITTLE APPETIZER. I WANT OUR
             PORKER TO KNOW WE'RE SERVING. I WANT
             TO PUT SOME IRON INTO THAT BIG YAP...

   HOOPER AND BRODY REACT AS WE

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

   EXT. THE OCEAN - AFTERNOON

   THE ORCA IS DRIFTING IN NEUTRAL. THE OCEAN IS LIKE GELATIN,
   THE SUN SUCKING HEAT WAVES FROM ITS SURFACE. BRODY AT THE
   STERN, HANDKERCHIEF ON HIS HEAD TO PROTECT FROM FURTHER
   SUNBURN, HAS BEEN HANDED THE SLIMIEST JOB ON A SHARK HUNT:
   THE LADLING OUT OF CHUM. THERE ARE SEVERAL EMPTY CHUM BARRELS.
   A FLAG BUOY BOBS IN THE WAKE OF THE BOAT, ANOTHER WAITS TO
   BE TOSSED OVER THE SIDE. BRODY IS REELING WITH NAUSEA. HE
   OPENS HIS OVERNIGHT KIT AND TAKES OUT A HANDKERCHIEF AND
   SOME OLD SPICE AFTER-SHAVE. HE POURS THE AFTER-SHAVE INTO
   THE CLOTH, PRESSES IT TO HIS NOSE. HOOPER IS ALSO IN THE
   STERN.

                         QUINT
             KEEP THAT CHUM LINE GOING -- WE'VE
             GOT FIVE GOOD MILES. DON'T BREAK IT.

                         BRODY
             WHO'S DRIVING THE BOAT?

                         QUINT
             NOBODY. WE'RE DRIFTING WITH THE
             CURRENT.

                         HOOPER
                  (USING THE FISH FINDER)
             NOTHING. NOTHING, NOTHING, NOTHING.

                         QUINT
                  (TO HOOPER)
             HELL, IN THE OLD DAYS WE WENT OUT
             WITH GOOD CHARTS, GOOD SOUNDING LEAD,
             AND A DAMN GOOD COMPASS. NOWADAYS,
             THESE KIDS ARE AFRAID TO GO OUT
             WITHOUT DEPTH FINDERS, RADAR, RADIO,
             ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH, EVERY STUPID
             THING...

   QUINT OPENS A CAN OF BEER AND DRAINS IT IN ONE LONG PULL,
   CRUSHING THE EMPTY AND THROWING IT OVER THE SIDE. HOOPER
   DRAINS HIS COFFEE FROM A STYROFOAM CUP, AND CRACKS IT IN HIS
   HAND WITH A SILLY "PLUP." HE STOWS THE PIECES IN AN EMPTY
   CHUM BARREL.

                         QUINT
                  (TO BRODY)
             GET A FRESH BARREL.

   BRODY GOES TO UNLASH A FRESH BARREL, BUT CAN'T FIGURE OUT
   THE KNOTS. HE FINALLY TUGS ON A PIECE OF ROPE, AND IT ALL
   COMES LOOSE... BARREL, SHARK CAGE, AND, MOST IMPORTANT,
   HOOPER'S TANKS, CLATTERING AND ROLLING ON THE DECK.

                         HOOPER
                  (JUMPING UP)
             WATCH IT! COMPRESSED AIR -- YOU SCREW
             AROUND WITH ONE OF THOSE AND BOOM!
             CAREFUL, HUH?

                         QUINT
                  (MUTTERS)
             REAL FINE STUFF BUT IT WON'T MEAN A
             THING TO MR. WHITEY, OF COURSE... HE
             DIDN'T GO TO SCHOOLS IN ELECTRONICS.
             HE WAS BORN WITH WHAT HE DOES BEST.
             EAT. HE'S A SWIMMING APPETITE. 'COURSE
             HE MIGHT EAT THIS STUFF, BUT THEN
             I'VE SEEN HIM EAT A ROCKING CHAIR,
             TOO.
                  (TO BRODY)
             NEXT TIME, ASK ME.

                                                  DISSOLVE TO:

   LATER

   THE MEN ARE IN DIFFERENT POSITIONS ON THE BOAT. HOOPER ON
   THE FLYING BRIDGE. QUINT IN THE STERN, BRODY HANGING OVER
   THE RAIL, PUKING.

   QUINT TAKES A WIDE RED STRIP OF WHALE MEAT AND A GNARLED
   SQUID FROM THE GARBAGE PAIL, AND SEARCHES FOR A NO. 2 HOOK
   RIG. HE HOLDS UP A STRIP OF WHALE.

                         HOOPER
                  (EYEING BAIT)
             THAT'S PILOT WHALE, ISN'T IT?

                         QUINT
             IT AIN'T A BIG MAC.
                  (TO BRODY)
             THE EXPERT DON'T APPROVE. WHAT DO
             YOU THING? YOU'RE CLOSER TO THE
             SITUATION.
                  (LAUGHS)

   BRODY SHADES HIS EYES FROM THE WHITE SUN AS QUINT BAITS UP.

                         BRODY
                  (CROAKY)
             WHY ARE WE WAY OUT HERE, WHEN THE
             SHARK'S BACK THERE?

                         QUINT
                  (SNAPPING BAIT TO HIS
                  LEADER)
             ...'CAUSE THIS IS WHERE HE LIVES.
             YOU GOTTA THINK LIKE THEY DO.

                         HOOPER
                  (TO HIMSELF)
             EASY FOR YOU -- THEY GOT A BRAIN THE
             SIZE OF A RADISH.

   QUINT SITS IN THE FIGHTING CHAIR. HE CASTS OFF, MURMURING AS
   THE LINE FEEDS OUT.

                         QUINT
                  (TO BRODY)
             NOW IF HE WEREN'T AROUND, WE'D OF
             HOOKED SOMETHING ELSE BY NOW, WOULDN'T
             WE? BUT HE SCARED 'EM ALL AWAY. BIG
             LONESOME SON OF A BITCH...

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

   LATER

   QUINT AT EASE IN HIS CHAIR, BRODY NEAR HIM, PRACTICING TYING
   KNOTS. THE LINE STARTS TO MOVE, A FEW FEET AT A TIME; BOTH
   MEN WATCH. THEN THE LINE WHIZZES OFF THE REEL. BRODY JUMPS
   UP. HOOPER SPRINGS TO THE DECK. QUINT PUTS HIS HAND ON THE
   DRAG AND ADDRESSES THE SITUATION SOFTLY.

                         QUINT
             -- HE'LL GULP IT DOWN NOW...
                  (MAKING GULPING NOISES)
             HOOOOOOO!

   QUINT TIGHTENS DRAG AND STRIKES. THE LINE GOES WHIZZING OUT.

   BRODY RUNS TO QUINT'S SIDE. HOOPER SPRINGS UP TO THE FLYING
   BRIDGE.

                         BRODY
             YOU GOT IT?

                         QUINT
                  (TURNING WITH THE
                  PULL)
             GET BEHIND ME, DUMMY!
                  (SHOUTS TO HOOPER)
             REVERSE HER AND TURN -- HE'S TAKING
             TOO MUCH LINE!
                  (TO BRODY)
             WET MY REEL, QUICK!

   BRODY GOES TO GET WATER, THE BOAT SURGES, HE STAGGERS. BRODY
   POURS WATER ON THE SCREAMING REEL, NEARLY UNSPOOLED NOW.

   HOOPER IS TURNING THE BOAT AROUND AND THE LINE CHANGES
   DIRECTION.

                         QUINT
                  (STRAINING, MUSCLES
                  POPPING)
             STARBOARD, FOR CHRIS'SAKE --

   HOOPER STEERS IT SHARPLY.

                         QUINT
                  (TO HOOPER)
             HEY, YOU! FARMER! HALF-SPEED THERE...

                         HOOPER
                  (ALMOST TO HIMSELF)
             AYE, AYE SIR. STAND BY TO REPEL
             BOARDERS. POOP THE MAINSAIL. ARGH,
             JIM BOY.

   AGAIN THE LINE CHANGES DIRECTION, DOWN THIS TIME.

                         QUINT
                  (TO HOOPER)
             NEUTRAL!
                  (TO HIMSELF)
             WHERE THE HELL IS HE GOING?

   QUINT REELING IN LIKE MAD.

                         QUINT
             OH, THIS AIN'T FOOLIN' ME --
                  (ROD ARCS DOWN WITH A
                  SURGE)
             SURE -- TRY IT!

   HE AD LIBS BRIEF INSTRUCTIONS TO BRODY AS THE LINE RUSHES
   OUT AND THERE IS LESS TENSION. QUINT IS HORSING UP AND DOWN,
   REELING IN.

                         QUINT
             MAKIN' BELIEVE IT'S EASY NOW.

   THE LINE IS ALMOST VERTICAL, AND QUINT SHOWS A HINT OF
   BAFFLEMENT. HE REELS IN SUSPICIOUSLY.

                         QUINT
             GETTIN' READY TO RUN AGAIN -- NO?
             NO?
                  (SUSPICIOUS)
             WHAT'S HE PLAYIN' HERE?
                  (REELS IN FURIOUSLY,
                  TO BRODY)
             PUT THE GLOVES ON!
                  (TO FISH)
             LET'S SEE WHO'S GONNA TEASE WHO NOW!

                         HOOPER
             LET IT GO, DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.

                         QUINT
                  (TO HOOPER)
             DOWN HERE, HOOPER!

   HOOPER IS RUSHING DOWN.

                         HOOPER
             I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS, BUT IT'S
             NOT A SHARK.

                         QUINT
                  (BATHED IN SWEAT;
                  HAULING, REELING)
             LOOK -- YOU MAY BE A BIG YAHOO IN
             THE LAB, BUT OUT HERE YOU'RE JUST
             SUPERCARGO, AND YOU'LL DO AS I SAY,
             OR YOU CAN TAKE YOUR GEAR AND
             BACKSTROKE HOME. NOW GET DOWN HERE!

   THE LEADERS SHOW ABOVE THE WATER LINE. BRODY IS WIDE-EYED,
   WAITING FOR THAT FIRST LOOK.

                         BRODY
             THE WIRE'S SHOWING!

                         QUINT
                  (TO BRODY)
             UNBUCKLE ME -- FAST!
                  (TO HOOPER)
             GRAB THE LEADER. HE AIN'T NORMAL,
             THIS ONE... THEY NEVER --

                         HOOPER
             IT'S TOO WILD, TOO ERRATIC. IT'S A
             MARLIN OR A STINGRAY. IT'S A GAMEFISH.

   HOOPER SNAPS THE ROPE ONTO THE LEADER AND HOLDS ON.

                         QUINT
             WATCH YOUR HANDS --
                  (SUDDENLY TO BRODY)
             GRAB ONTO THIS!

   BEFORE HE REALIZES WHAT'S HAPPENING, BRODY IS CLUMSILY
   CLUTCHING AT THE BIG ROD, APPALLED. QUINT SKIPS AWAY FOR A
   FLYING GAFF. HE PICKS ONE, TURNS...

   THAT'S WHEN THE LEADER LASHES FREE, SENDING HOOPER CRASHING
   BACKWARD IN A SERIOUS FALL, AND THE ROD WHIPS AT BRODY'S
   FOREHEAD, DRAWING BLOOD. QUINT SNATCHES UP THE ROD AND REELS
   IN.

   THE WIRES HAVE BEEN BITTEN THROUGH.

                         QUINT
                  (TO HOOPER)
             A MARLIN, OR A STINGRAY. HUH. DON'T
             EVER TELL ME MY BUSINESS AGAIN. GET
             BACK UP ON THE BRIDGE.

                         HOOPER
                  (STUNNED)
             I'M OKAY...

                         QUINT
                  (TO BRODY)
             FASTEN THE POLE.

                         BRODY
             WHAT'S THE POINT WITH HOOKS AND LINES? --

                         QUINT
             DON'T TELL ME MY BUSINESS!
                  (TO HOOPER, POINTS)
             QUARTER-MILE, THAT WAY. FULL THROTTLE.

   HOOPER SHAKES OFF HIS DIZZINESS AND OBEYS. BRODY WATCHES
   QUINT RIG UP A NEW LEADER, HOOK UP THE SAME BAIT.

                         BRODY
                  (NURSING FOREHEAD,
                  GESTURING AT ROD AND
                  REEL)
             HOW -- IF THEY'RE GONNA KEEP ON
             BREAKING?

                         QUINT
             WHAT I DO IS TRICK HIM TO THE SURFACE,
             GOT THAT? THEN I CAN JAB HIM,
             UNDERSTAND?
                  (GOES TO FLYBRIDGE,
                  MUTTERING)
             THINK I'M GONNA HAUL IT IN AS IF
             HE'S A CATFISH, LIKE EVERYONE ELSE
             DOES?

   BRODY GOES INSIDE TO INSPECT HIS FOREHEAD.

   ON BRIDGE - HOOPER AND QUINT

                         QUINT
                  (SUDDENLY, POINTING)
             OVER THERE!

                         HOOPER
             WHAT DO YOU SEE?

                         QUINT
                  (STILL LOOKING)
             AT LEAST YOU HANDLE THE BOAT ALL
             RIGHT. STOP. HERE... CUT THE ENGINE.

   HOOPER CUTS THE ENGINES AS QUINT SWINGS NIMBLY DOWN. HE STANDS
   STOCK STILL ON THE MAIN DECK, MOTIONING BRODY TO BE SILENT.

   THEN PICKING UP THE NEWLY RIGGED ROD, QUINT SOFTSHOES IT
   OVER TO THE CHAIR. ABOUT TO SIT DOWN, HE FREEZES.

   CLOSE - QUINT

   LOOKING HARD AT SOMETHING.

   CLOSE - BRODY

   STARING, EYES WIDENING.

   CLOSE - HOOPER

   MOVING IN, SURPRISED, INTERESTED, FASCINATED.

   THEIR COMBINED POINT OF VIEW

   WE SEE THE SHARK. FIRST THE FIN... THEN THE HEAD AND UPPER
   JAWS, TEN OR TWENTY YARDS OFF THE SIDE OF THE BOAT. IT FINALLY
   SUBMERGES, ITS TAIL GIVING A FINAL SLAP.

   ANGLE ON QUINT

   HE PUTS HIS ROD AWAY AND STARES AT IT. AND STARES. AND STARES.

   HOOPER IS THE FIRST TO BREAK THE SILENCE.

                         HOOPER
             20 FEET, IF IT'S AN INCH...

                         QUINT
             25 FEET. AND THREE TONS OF HIM THERE.

   HOOPER IS NEARLY BESIDE HIMSELF WITH A STRANGE ECSTASY. HE
   LEAPS TOWARD HIS GEAR.

                         QUINT
                  (QUIETLY, TO BRODY)
             I NEVER SAW ONE THAT BIG.

                         BRODY
             WHAT DO WE DO? GET SOME HELP? RADIO
             IN?

   QUINT IGNORES HIM AND MOVES OFF INTO THE PILOT HOUSE, WHERE
   HE SWIFTLY TAKES OUT HIS GREEN CASE, AND OPENS IT TO BEGIN
   TO ASSEMBLE SOMETHING INSIDE IT. BRODY IS ALONE ON THE DECK
   WITH HOOPER.

                         BRODY
             HOW'RE WE GONNA HANDLE THIS?

   HOOPER IS CONTAINED IN HIS OWN EXCITEMENT. HE HAS FINALLY
   COME UP WITH WHAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR -- AN EXPENSIVE NIKON
   THROUGH WHICH HE PEERS INTENTLY AT THE SHARK ALONGSIDE. HE
   IS TALKING HALF TO HIMSELF AS HE FINE-TUNES THE RANGE FINDER
   AND FOCUS.

   HE IS SQUEAKING AND BUBBLING IN AN UNSUPPRESSED EMOTIONAL
   BOIL.

                         HOOPER
                  (VERY, VERY HIGH)
             THERE'S A FORMULA! GIRTH, ABOUT 150
             INCHES, SQUARED, DIVIDE BY 800 --
             SON OF A BITCH, THEY ARE NOT GOING
             TO BELIEVE THIS! -- DIVIDE BY 2000...
             THREE TONS!
                  (AFTER QUINT)
             YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU OLD FART! THREE
             TONS!
                  (AD LIBS ECSTASY)

   CLOSE ON QUINT IN THE PILOT HOUSE

   HE IS ASSEMBLING THE GREENER HARPOON GUN, DEFTLY SCREWING ON
   THE LONG WOODEN STOCK, THE HEAVY STEEL BARREL, AND BIG SHAFT
   WITH THE WICKED BARBS, THE FRAME ALL RIGGED WITH LINE. PAST
   HIM, ON THE DECK, WE CAN STILL SEE HOOPER. AS QUINT IS WORKING
   WITH THE GUN, THE RADIO SUDDENLY SQUAWKS INTO LIFE.

                         RADIO VOICE (V.O.)
             AMITY POINT LIGHT STATION TO ORCA.
             THIS IS AMITY POINT LIGHT STATION,
             TO ORCA...

   QUINT SNAPS THE MOUTHPIECE TO HIS LIPS.

                         QUINT
             ORCA HERE.

                         RADIO VOICE (V.O.)
             I HAVE MRS. MARTIN BRODY HERE...

                         QUINT
             PUT HER ON.

                         ELLEN'S VOICE
             ...PUSH THIS? OH. IT'S WORKING. HELLO,
             MARTIN?

                         QUINT
             THIS IS QUINT, MISSUS.

                         ELLEN'S VOICE
             I JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU WERE
             ALL RIGHT... THE COAST GUARD LET ME
             USE THEIR RADIO. IS CHIEF BRODY THERE?

                         QUINT
             HE'S BUSY.

                         ELLEN'S VOICE
             WELL... IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

                         QUINT
             JUST FINE, MISSUS. WE'LL BE BACK
             SOON. EVERYTHING'S FINE. WE HAVEN'T
             SEEN ANYTHING YET. ORCA OUT.

   HE SNAPS OFF THE RADIO, AND, FOR GOOD MEASURE, PULLS THE
   PLUG FROM THE POWER SOURCE.

   ANGLE FROM DECK

   THE BIG SHARK IS SLICING THROUGH THE WATER JUST BELOW THE
   SURFACE, ITS FIN HIGH, THE BIG GRAY BACK GLISTENING, THE
   TEETH GLEAMING.

   ANGLE - INCLUDING FOREDECK

                         HOOPER
                  (ON DECK)
             DAMN IT! I NEED SOMETHING IN THE
             FOREGROUND TO GIVE IT SOME SCALE.
             MARTIN! STAND HERE! NO, TO YOUR LEFT!

   HE IS POSITIONING MARTIN FRANTICALLY, TRYING TO INCLUDE BRODY,
   THE SHARK, AND THE ORCA IN THE SAME FRAME. QUINT FINISHES
   WITH THE GUN, AND AS A FINAL GESTURE, SNAPS AN EXPLOSIVE
   CARTRIDGE INTO THE BREECH. HE EMPTIES THE BOX OF CARTRIDGES
   ONTO THE TABLE, SNATCHES UP A BIG HANDFUL, AND DROPS THEM
   INTO A POCKET, AND HEADS OUT ON DECK, BOUND FOR THE BOW
   PULPIT.

   ON DECK

   QUINT APPEARS WITH THE HARPOON GUN. HE THROWS ONE END OF THE
   LINE TO HOOPER.

                         QUINT
             HERE. RIG THIS TO THE FORWARD KEG UP
             THERE.

   HE INDICATES THE BARRELS ON THE FOREDECK.

                         QUINT
                  (TO BRODY)
             GET UP THERE AND STEER HER. FOLLOW
             MY HAND, AND HOLD 'ER STEADY. I'VE
             GOT TO GET A CLEAN SHOT AT THAT
             PORKER'S HEAD.

   QUINT MOVES UP TOWARD THE BOW, BRODY GOES UP TO THE FLYING
   BRIDGE TO TAKE THE WHEEL, HOOPER STARTS FOR THE FOREDECK,
   BUT STOPS TO RUMMAGE IN HIS KIT, THROWING GEAR AROUND AS HE
   DESPERATELY HUNTS FOR SOMETHING.

                         QUINT
             HURRY UP, RIG THE LINE!

   ANGLE ON HOOPER

   HE FINDS WHAT HE'S LOOKING FOR. A SMALL, POWERFUL STROBE
   UNIT, WATERPROOFED, A MINIATURE SIGNAL BEACON. HE TRIGGERS
   IT, AND IT BEGINS TO PULSE WITH A LIGHT WE CAN SEE EVEN IN
   THE SUN.

   HOOPER SCAMPERS TO THE FOREDECK AND BEGINS TO RIG THE LIGHT
   TO THE FIRST BARREL, AS THE SHARK BEGINS TO SURFACE NEAR THE
   BOW.

                         QUINT
                  (TO BRODY)
             COME TO PORT. WATCH MY HAND. STEADY
             NOW...

   HE GUIDES BRODY WITH HAND SIGNALS. BRODY TRIES URGENTLY TO
   GET IT RIGHT, NOT TO OVERSTEER, TO TRY TO HOLD THE BIG BOAT
   WITH ITS THROBBING DIESELS ON THE COURSE THAT QUINT IS
   INDICATING.

                         QUINT
             THE LINE, MAN, THE LINE!

   HOOPER IS RIGGING LIKE CRAZY.

   FROM THE FLYING BRIDGE

   BRODY STEERING F.G., HOOPER ON THE FOREDECK WITH THE BARRELS,
   QUINT LEANING OUT OVER THE PULPIT, THE GUN AT THE READY, THE
   SHARK CROSSING INEXORABLY IN FRONT OF THEM.

   CLOSE ON QUINT

   AGONIZING OVER HIS SHOT AS THE SHARK APPROACHES, GLANCING
   BACK TO SEE IF THE LINE IS PROPERLY RIGGED AND HOOPER IS
   CLEAR OF IT.

                         QUINT
             GET CLEAR, DAMN YOU!

   THE SHARK IS IN POSITION, HOOPER SHOUTS, A MOMENT TOO LATE.

                         HOOPER
             CLEAR!

   QUINT FIRES. THE HARPOON SLAMS INTO THE SHARK BEHIND HIS
   HEAD, HALF-WAY ALONG THE BACK IN FRONT OF THE BIG DORSAL
   FIN.

                         QUINT
             JESUS H. CHRIST ON A CRUTCH!

   INSERT - COILED ROPE AND BARREL

   THE ROPE SNAPS OUT IN A BLUR OF VIOLENT MOTION, HOOPER JUMPS
   BACK, AND THE BARREL LEAPS OUT OF ITS RACK, PULLED BY THE
   LINE RIGGED TO THE HARPOON. IT BOUNDS FORWARD AND INTO THE
   SEA, PAST QUINT, WHO IS ALREADY RELOADING, MOUNTING ANOTHER
   STEEL SHAFT. IN THE DISTANCE, THE BARREL BOBS AND SKIPS
   VIOLENTLY IN THE WATER, DRAGGED BY THE SHARK IN HIS MERCILESS
   MOVES.

   THE FOREDECK - QUINT

                         QUINT
             NOW YOU'VE DONE IT, YOU PISS-ANT.
             STOP AND RIG A GODDAM TINKER TOY TO
             MY GEAR. LET THE BASTARD FIGHT THE
             KEG FOR A WHILE. HE CAN'T STAY DOWN
             WITH THAT ON.

   HOOPER, FURIOUS WITH HIMSELF, RUNS FOR THE FLYING BRIDGE TO
   TAKE THE HELM FROM BRODY.

   THE FLYING BRIDGE, BRODY AND HOOPER

   HOOPER HAS SNATCHED THE WHEEL, AND IS RAMMING THE THROTTLE
   FORWARD AS HE SPINS THE WHEEL IN A FRANTIC 180 DEGREE TURN.

                         HOOPER
                  (TO QUINT)
             RIG ANOTHER KEG! I'M BRINGING HER
             AROUND!

   HIS EYES DART ABOUT THE OCEAN, LOOKING FOR THE BARREL, AS HE
   HOT-DOGS THE SHIP AROUND IN A VIOLENT EXPRESSION OF HIS OWN
   DISGUST WITH HIMSELF.

                         HOOPER
                  (TO HIMSELF)
             GOD DAMN IT! WE HAD HIM!
                  (TO QUINT)
             I'M COMING ABOUT!

   HE SPINS THE WHEEL AGAIN, TRYING TO MAKE THE BIG BOAT HANDLE
   LIKE A FORMULA SPEEDSTER. THE DECKS TIP AND THE RIGGING SWAYS
   UNDER THE SUDDEN STRAIN. BRODY IS CAUGHT UNAWARE, AND TUMBLES
   OFF HIS FEET, SLIDING ACROSS THE DECK TO FETCH UP AGAINST A
   WALL. THE M1 RIFLE IS CLOSE TO HIS HAND. HE STARES AT IT.

   FROM THE FLYING BRIDGE

   HOOPER IS ANGUISHED, INTENSE, TRYING TO FIND THE SHARK,
   SPINNING THE WHEEL, COMPOUNDING HIS ERROR, TIPPING THE BOAT
   IN ROLLING TURNS AS HE CROSSES HIS OWN WAKE. QUINT HAS TURNED
   HIS BACK TO THE SEA, AND IS IN THE PULPIT LOOKING UP AT
   HOOPER, STARING AT HIM, EXCLUDING EVERYTHING ELSE.

   AS QUINT FOLDS HIS ARMS AND STARES AT HOOPER, WE REALIZE THE
   SUN IS GOING DOWN, AND IT'S GETTING DARK.

                         BRODY
             WHY DON'T WE GO IN? GET ANOTHER CRACK
             AT HIM TOMORROW.

                         QUINT
             WE GOT A BARREL ON HIM. WE CAN'T
             LOSE HIM. WE STAY OUT HERE UNTIL WE
             FIND HIM.

   HOOPER THROTTLES BACK, AND THE ROAR OF THE DIESELS SUBSIDES
   AND THE BOAT RESUMES AN EVEN KEEL, SLOWLY CIRCLING THE OCEAN.

                         BRODY
             LET'S CALL IN -- WE CAN RADIO AND
             HAVE A BIG BOAT HERE IN AN HOUR...

                         QUINT
                  (GRIM)
             YOU HIRED ME, REMEMBER? IT'S MY
             $10,000. IT'S MY SHARK...

   EXT. ORCA - OPEN SEA - NIGHT

   THROTTLED BACK TO SLOW AHEAD, THE BOAT CIRCLES THE WATER
   ENDLESSLY, STAYING OVER THE SHARK LIKE AN AVENGING ANGEL.
   ITS RUNNING LIGHTS GLEAM IN THE NIGHT, AND A GLOW LIGHTS THE
   INTERIOR OF THE PILOT HOUSE. A BRIGHT STROBE GLINTS ON THE
   WATER WINKING ONCE LIKE A FIREFLY.

   INT. PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

   BRODY AND HOOPER AT THE TABLE, QUINT AT THE WHEEL, KEEPING
   HIS EYE ON THE LIGHT.

                         QUINT
             HE'S UP AGAIN.

   HE CORRECTS COURSE SLIGHTLY TO KEEP THE BARREL BUOY IN SIGHT.

   HOOPER IS SITTING AT THE TABLE, MOROSE. BRODY IS STARING AT
   A COUPLE OF OPEN CANS OF BEANS OR BEEF STEW, OR SOME OTHER
   CRAPPY RATIONS QUINT HAS ON BOARD. DIRTY SPOONS STUCK IN THE
   OPEN CANS SHOW US THIS HAS NOT BEEN A FORMAL DINNER. QUINT
   FUMBLES ON THE CHART SHELF AND PRODUCES SOME OF HIS HOME
   BREW.

   HE TAKES A PULL, AND HANDS IT TO HOOPER, WHO TAKES A DOUBLE.

   BRODY TOUCHES THE FRESH ABRASION ON HIS FOREHEAD, WHERE THE
   FISHING ROD CAUGHT HIM.

   QUINT BENDS FORWARD AND PULLS HIS HAIR ASIDE TO SHOW SOMETHING
   NEAR THE CROWN.

                         QUINT
             THAT'S NOT SO BAD. LOOK AT THIS:
             ...ST. PADDY'S DAY IN KNOCKO NOLANS,
             IN BOSTON, WHERE SOME SUNOVABITCH
             WINGED ME UPSIDE THE HEAD WITH A
             SPITTOON.

   BRODY LOOKS POLITELY. HOOPER STIRS HIMSELF.

                         HOOPER
             LOOK HERE.
                  (EXTENDS A FOREARM)
             STEVE KAPLAN BIT ME DURING RECESS.

   QUINT IS AMUSED. HE PRESENTS HIS OWN FORMIDABLE FOREARM.

                         QUINT
             WIRE BURN. TRYING TO STOP A BACKSTAY
             FROM TAKING MY HEAD OFF.

                         HOOPER
                  (ROLLING UP A SLEEVE)
             MORAY EEL. BIT RIGHT THROUGH A WET
             SUIT.

   BRODY IS FASCINATED. QUINT AND HOOPER TAKE A LONG PULL FROM
   THE BOTTLE.

                         QUINT
             FACE AND HEAD SCARS COME FROM AMATEUR
             AMUSEMENTS IN THE BAR ROOM. THIS
             LOVE LINE HERE...
                  (HE BENDS AN EAR
                  FORWARD)
             ...THAT'S FROM SOME CRAZY FRENCHIE
             COME AFTER ME WITH A KNIFE. I CAUGHT
             HIM WITH A GOOD RIGHT HAND RIGHT IN
             THE SNOT LOCKER AND LAID HIM AMONGST
             THE SWEETPEAS.

                         HOOPER
             EVER SEE ONE LIKE THIS?

   HE HAULS UP HIS PANTS LEG, REVEALING A WICKED WHITE SCAR.

                         HOOPER
             BULL SHARK SCRAPED ME WHILE I WAS
             TAKING SAMPLES...

                         QUINT
             NOTHING! A PLEASURE SCAR. LOOK HERE --

   HE STARTS ROLLING UP HIS OWN DIRTY PANTS LEG.

                         QUINT
             SLAMMED WITH A THRESHER'S TAIL. LOOK
             JUST LIKE SOMEBODY CARESSED ME WITH
             A NUTMEG GRATER...

   BRODY IS DRAWN INTO THEIR BOASTING COMPARISONS. HE SECRETLY
   CHECKS HIS OWN APPENDIX SCAR, DECIDES NOT TO ENTER THE
   CONTEST.

                         HOOPER
             I'LL DRINK TO YOUR LEG.

                         QUINT
             AND I'LL DRINK TO YOURS.

   THEY TOAST EACH OTHER. BRODY LOOKS AROUND, SEES THE STROBE
   BLINK ONCE THROUGH THE DARKENED WINDOW.

                         QUINT
             WAIT A MINUTE, YOUNG FELLA. LOOK.
             JUST LOOK. DON'T TOUCH...

   HE STARTS LOWERING HIS PANTS TO REVEAL A PLACE ON ONE HIP
   WHERE THE TISSUE IS SCARRED AND IRREGULAR.

                         QUINT
             ...MAKO. FELL OUT OF THE TAIL ROPE
             AND ONTO THE DECK. YOU DON'T GET
             BITTEN BY ONE OF THOSE BASTARDS BUT
             TWICE -- YOUR FIRST AND YOUR LAST.

                         HOOPER
                  (CONSIDERABLY DRUNKER)
             I THINK I CAN TOP THAT, MISTER...

   HOOPER IS PULLING AT HIS SHIRT, TRYING TO GET IT OFF, BUT
   IT'S TANGLING ITS SLEEVES, AND WON'T COME UNDONE.

                         HOOPER
             GIMME A HAND, HERE. I GOT SOMETHING
             TO SHOW YOU --

   BRODY LENDS A HAND. THE SHIRT SLIPS PART WAY OFF.

                         HOOPER
                  (INDICATING HIS CHEST)
             THERE. RIGHT THERE. MARY ELLEN MOFFIT
             BROKE MY HEART. LET'S DRINK TO MARY
             ELLEN.

   THE TWO MEN RAISE THEIR MUGS IN A TOAST.

                         QUINT
             AND HERE'S TO THE LADIES. AND HERE'S
             TO THEIR SISTERS; I'D RATHER ONE
             MISS THAN A SHIPLOAD OF MISTERS.

   HE DRINKS, HOOPER FOLLOWS.

                         QUINT
                  (SHOWS BELLY)
             LOOK A' THAT -- BAYONET IWO JIMA.

                         BRODY
                  (ASIDE)
             C'MON. MIDDLE APPENDIX --

                         QUINT
                  (ASIDE)
             I ALMOST HAD 'IM.

   BRODY IS LOOKING AT A SMALL WHITE PATCH ON QUINT'S OTHER
   FOREARM.

                         BRODY
                  (POINTING)
             WHAT'S THAT ONE, THERE?

                         QUINT
                  (CHANGING)
             TATTOO. HAD IT TAKEN OFF.

                         HOOPER
             DON'T TELL ME -- 'DEATH BEFORE
             DISHONOR.' 'MOTHER.' 'SEMPER FI.'
             UHHH... 'DON'T TREAD ON ME.' C'MON --
             WHAT?

                         QUINT
             'U.S.S INDIANAPOLIS.' 1944.

                         BRODY
             WHAT'S THAT, A SHIP?

                         HOOPER
                  (INCREDULOUS)
             YOU WERE ON THE INDIANAPOLIS? IN
             '45? JESUS...

   QUINT REMEMBERING.

   CLOSE ON QUINT

                         QUINT
             YEAH. THE U.S.S. INDIANAPOLIS.
             JUNE 29TH, 1945, THREE AND A HALF
             MINUTES PAST MIDNIGHT, TWO TORPEDOES
             FROM A JAPANESE SUBMARINE SLAMMED
             INTO OUR SIDE. TWO OR THREE. WE WAS
             STILL UNDER SEALED ORDERS AFTER
             DELIVERIN' THE BOMB...THE HIROSHIMA
             BOMB...WE WAS GOIN' BACK ACROSS THE
             PACIFIC FROM TINIAN TO LEYTE. DAMN
             NEAR ELEVEN HUNDRED MEN WENT OVER
             THE SIDE. THE LIFE BOATS WAS LASHED
             DOWN SO TIGHT TO MAKE THE BOMB RUN
             WE COULDN'T CUT A SINGLE ONE ADRIFT.
             NOT ONE. AND THERE WAS NO RAFTS.
             NONE. THAT VESSEL SANK IN TWELVE
             MINUTES. YES, THAT'S ALL SHE TOOK.
             WE DIDN'T SEE THE FIRST SHARK TILL
             WE'D BEEN IN THE WATER ABOUT AN HOUR.
             A THIRTEEN-FOOTER NEAR ENOUGH. A
             BLUE. YOU MEASURE THAT BY JUDGIN'
             THE DORSAL TO THE TAIL. WHAT WE DIDN'T
             KNOW... OF COURSE THE CAPTAIN KNEW...I
             GUESS SOME OFFICERS KNEW... WAS THE
             BOMB MISSION HAD BEEN SO SECRET, NO
             DISTRESS SIGNALS WAS SENT. WHAT THE
             MEN DIDN'T KNOW WAS THAT THEY WOULDN'T
             EVEN LIST US AS OVERDUE FOR A WEEK.
             WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT -- I WASN'T
             AN OFFICER -- JUST AS WELL PERHAPS.
             SO SOME OF US WERE DEAD ALREADY --
             IN THE WATER -- JUST HANGIN' LIMP IN
             OUR LIFEJACKETS. AND SEVERAL ALREADY
             BLEEDIN'. AND THE THREE HUNDRED OR
             SO LAYING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN.
             AS THE LIGHT WENT, THE SHARKS CAME
             CRUSIN'. WE FORMED TIGHT GROUPS --
             SOMEWHAT LIKE SQUARES IN AN OLD BATTLE --
             YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN -- SO THAT WHEN
             ONE COME CLOSE, THE MAN NEAREST WOULD
             YELL AND SHOUT AND POUND THE WATER
             AND SOMETIMES IT WORKED AND THE FISH
             TURNED AWAY, BUT OTHER TIMES THAT
             SHARK WOULD SEEM TO LOOK RIGHT AT A
             MAN -- RIGHT INTO HIS EYES -- AND IN
             SPITE OF ALL SHOUTIN' AND POUNDIN'
             YOU'D HEAR THAT TERRIBLE HIGH
             SCREAMIN' AND THE OCEAN WOULD GO
             RED, THEN CHURN UP AS THEY RIPPED
             HIM.  THEN WE'D REFORM OUR LITTLE
             SQUARES. BY THE FIRST DAWN THE SHARKS
             HAD TAKEN MORE THAN A HUNDRED. HARD
             FOR ME TO COUNT BUT MORE THAN A
             HUNDRED. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY SHARKS.
             MAYBE A THOUSAND. I DO KNOW THEY
             AVERAGED SIX MEN AN HOUR. ALL KINDS --
             BLUES, MAKOS, TIGERS. ALL KINDS.
                  (PAUSE)
             IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SECOND DAY,
             SOME OF US STARTED TO GO CRAZY FROM
             THE THIRST. ONE FELLA CRIED OUT HE
             SAW A RIVER, ANOTHER CLAIMED HE SAW
             A WATERFALL, SOME STARTED TO DRINK
             THE OCEAN AND CHOKED ON IT, AND SOME
             LEFT OUR LITTLE GROUPS -- OUR LITTLE
             SQUARES -- AND SWAM OFF ALONE LOOKIN'
             FOR ISLANDS AND THE SHARKS ALWAYS
             TOOK THEM RIGHT AWAY. IT WAS MAINLY
             THE YOUNG FELLAS THAT DID THAT --
             THE OLDER ONES STAYED WHERE THEY
             WAS. THAT SECOND DAY -- MY LIFE JACKET
             RUBBED ME RAW AND THAT WAS MORE BLOOD
             IN THE WATER. OH MY. ON THURSDAY
             MORNING I BUMPED UP AGAINST A FRIEND
             OF MINE -- HERBIE ROBINSON FROM
             CLEVELAND -- A BOSUN'S MATE -- IT
             SEEMED HE WAS ASLEEP BUT WHEN I
             REACHED OVER TO WAKEN HIM, HE BOBBED
             IN THE WATER AND I SAW HIS BODY UPEND
             BECAUSE HE'D BEEN BITTEN IN HALF
             BENEATH THE WAIST. WELL CHIEF, SO IT
             WENT ON -- BOMBERS HIGH OVERHEAD BUT
             NOBODY NOTICIN' US. YES -- SUICIDES,
             SHARKS, AND ALL THIS GOIN' CRAZY AND
             DYIN' OF THIRST. NOON THE FIFTH DAY,
             MR. HOOPER, A LOCKHEED VENTURA SWUNG
             AROUND AND CAME IN LOW. YES. HE DID
             THAT. YES, THAT PILOT SAW US. AND
             EARLY EVENIN', A BIG FAT PBY COME
             DOWN OUT OF THE SKY AND BEGAN THE
             PICKUP.  THAT WAS WHEN I WAS MOST
             FRIGHTENED OF ALL -- WHILE I WAS
             WAITIN' FOR MY TURN. JUST TWO AND A
             HALF HOURS SHORT OF FIVE DAYS AND
             FIVE NIGHTS WHEN THEY GOT TO ME AND
             TOOK ME UP. ELEVEN HUNDRED OF US
             WENT INTO THAT OCEAN -- THREE HUNDRED
             AND SIXTEEN GOT OUT. YEAH. NINETEEN
             HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE. JUNE THE
             29TH.
                  (PAUSE)
             ANYWAY, WE DELIVERED THE BOMB.

   EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT

   QUINT HAS JUST FINISHED HIS STORY, AND WE ARE LOOKING ACROSS
   THE QUIET NIGHT SEA TO THE ORCA SLOWLY CIRCLING IN THE NIGHT,
   THE WARM LIGHT IN THE PILOT HOUSE BARELY REVEALING THE FIGURES
   OF THE THREE MEN INSIDE, THE RED AND GREEN RUNNING LIGHTS
   WINKING ALONG THE SHIP'S FLANKS. WE HEAR THE DISTANT BOOM
   AND DRAWN-OUT HOOT OF A WHALE.

   INT. ORCA PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT

                         BRODY
             WHAT THE HELL?

                         HOOPER
             IT'S A WHALE OUT THERE.

   THERE'S A BRIEF, EERIE PAUSE. QUINT BREAKS THE SILENCE BY
   MUTTERING INTO SONG, WHICH HE SLOWLY SWELLS.

                         QUINT
                  (SINGING)
             SHOW ME THE WAY TO GO HOME... I'M
             TIRED AND I WANT TO GO TO BED. I HAD
             A LITTLE DRINK ABOUT AN HOUR AGO,
             AND IT WENT RIGHT TO MY HEAD.
                  (ETC.)

   GRADUALLY, HOOPER AND BRODY JOIN IN, AND THE PILOTHOUSE
   BECOMES A WARM COZY PLACE.

   EXT. OCEAN

   THE ORCA AND ITS SONG IN THE NIGHT. IN THE FOREGROUND, THE
   BARREL AND STROBE LIGHT FLASH UP INTO VIEW, AND BEHIND THEM,
   THE BIG DORSAL FIN SURFACES, AND GLIDES OMINOUSLY TOWARDS
   THE SHIP.

   INT. PILOT HOUSE

   THE SONG IS CONTINUING, AND WE HEAR THE BAREST HINT OF A
   SCRAPING SOUND FROM THE HULL DEEP BENEATH THE MEN. QUINT'S
   EYES ABRUPTLY NARROW AS HIS SENSITIVE EARS ARE THE FIRST TO
   HEAR THE ABRASION OF HIS SHIP. THINGS VIBRATE ON THE SHELVES.

   QUINT STOPS SINGING, HOOPER AND BRODY CONTINUE A DUET. THE
   SCRAPING REPEATS, AND HOOPER NOW SENSES IT. HE DROPS OUT OF
   THE SONG, LEAVING BRODY SINGING SOLO.

                         QUINT
                  (QUIETLY, TO HOOPER)
             START THE ENGINES.

   AS BRODY HEARS THIS AND IS ABOUT TO STOP SINGING, THE BOAT
   IS SUDDENLY BUMPED FROM BELOW, AND THE GENTLE SCRAPING TURNS
   TO A VIOLENT ASSAULT SOMEWHERE ON THE UNDERSTRUCTURE OF THE
   VESSEL. WATER BUBBLES UP INTO THE HOLD. BRODY STARTS, AND
   LOOKS AT THE RADIO. HE IS ABOUT TO MOVE TOWARDS IT WHEN
   QUINT'S URGENT INSTRUCTIONS STOP HIM.

                         QUINT
             HE'S BUSTING THE SHAFT! START THE
             PUMP!

                         BRODY
             WHERE...?

                         QUINT
             THE BILGE PUMPS. THERE --

   HE LEAVES BRODY IN THE PILOT HOUSE, AND RUNS ONTO THE DECK,
   GRABBING HIS M-1 RIFLE AS HE GOES. BRODY HITS A SWITCH AND
   WE HEAR THE PUMPS STARTING.

   ANGLE ON THE ORCA

   HOOPER IS ON THE FLYBRIDGE, STARTING THE ENGINES, BUT THE
   DIESELS SOUND WRONG.

                         QUINT
             CUT THE ENGINES!

   HOOPER DOES.

                         HOOPER
             RUDDER BEARINGS?

   THE BOAT IS ASSAULTED AGAIN. QUINT FIRES OVER THE STERN,
   EMPTYING A CLIP INTO THE WATER.

                         QUINT
                  (TO BRODY)
             GET UP FORWARD! WATCH FOR HIM!

   BRODY MOVES CAUTIOUSLY UP TO THE BOW.

                         QUINT
             KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN, MR. HOOPER!

   HOOPER STANDS READY ON THE BRIDGE, QUINT PACING THE STERN
   DECK.

                         QUINT
             NOBODY SLEEPS! NOBODY.

   HE JAMS A FRESH CLIP INTO THE M-1. THE MEN SCAN THE SEAS
   AROUND THEM. QUINT RESUMES THEIR SONG, LOUDER THIS TIME,
   MORE DEFIANT.

                         QUINT
                  (SINGS)
             SHOW ME THE WAY TO GO HOME... I'M
             TIRED AND I WANT TO GO TO BED.
                  (ETC.)

   HOOPER AND BRODY JOIN IN FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE POSITIONS.

   EXT. OCEAN, WIDE ON THE ORCA

   THE MEN IN PLACE, SINGING, THE WATER SPARKLING TOWARDS THE
   HORIZON, THE STARS TWINKLING ABOVE. THE SOUND OF A DISTANT
   WHALE IN DISTANT COUNTERPOINT.

   EXT. THE ORCA - DAWN

   BRODY IS AT THE WHEEL ON THE FLYING BRIDGE, WHILE HOOPER AND
   QUINT HAVE A HATCH UP ON THE STERN, AND ARE WORKING TOGETHER
   TO REPAIR THE DAMAGED RUDDER CONTROLS TORN LOOSE BY THE SHARK.
   HOOPER IS BUCKING THE STEEL ROD, WHILE QUINT IS HAMMERING
   AWAY AT THE JOINT, TRYING TO DRIVE A NEW PIN.

   THE ENGINE IS IDLING. BITS OF IRON CLUTTER THE DECK, ALONG
   WITH A FEW ROUGH, OUTSIZED TOOLS AND GREASY RAGS AND GASKETS.

                         QUINT
             MORE LEFT RUDDER! MORE! LEFT HAND
             DOWN NOW, CHIEF.

   BRODY TRIES TO COMPLY.

                         HOOPER
                  (SHIFTING HIS GRIP)
             LEMME GET A BETTER ANGLE ON IT. NOW.

   QUINT HAMMERS AGAIN.

                         QUINT
             HE'S BENT THE HOUSING. YOU CAN HEAR
             IT.

   AND WE CAN. THE ORCA'S DIESELS ARE NO LONGER SMOOTH. BRODY
   SUDDENLY SEES SOMETHING, AND POINTS.

   BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - THE WATER

   THE BARREL IS SURFACED DIRECTLY AHEAD OF THEM, JUST OFF THE
   PORT SIDE. THEY ARE DRIFTING UP TO IT.

                         BRODY
             THE BARREL!

   THE STROBE LIGHT WINKS AT THEM. QUINT HOLDS UP A HAND:
   "QUIET!"

   EVERYTHING STOPS AS THEY WATCH THE BARREL COMING SLOWLY UP
   ON THEM.

                         QUINT
             IT'S HIM.

   HE TAKES A KILLING LANCE FROM THE RACK. HOOPER GETS A
   BOATHOOK.

                         QUINT
             HE'S UNDER THE KEG. CAREFUL --

   HOOPER LEANS OUT GINGERLY, SNAGGING THE BARREL WITH THE HOOK.

   IT BOBS LIGHTLY IN THE WATER, AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER. HOOPER
   SHIFTS HIS POLE, TAKES HOLD OF THE ROPE, POLING IT IN.

                         QUINT
                  (SUSPICIOUS)
             EASY -- JUST WANT TO GOOSE HIM UP.
             THE MINUTE HE RUNS, DROP IT OR YOU'LL
             LOSE YOUR HANDS.

   HOOPER GETS THE LINE AND STARTS HAULING IT UP. NO RESISTANCE.

   IT COMES EASILY OVER THE TRANSOM INTO A COIL ON THE DECK.
   HE AND QUINT EXCHANGE LOOKS.

                         QUINT
             HERE -- GIMME. I DON'T SEE WHAT HE'S
             BEEN DOIN'.

   WATER - ANGLE

   BOTH MEN ARE DRAPED OVER THE SIDE, THEIR CHINS ALMOST TOUCHING
   THE WATER ON THE AFT SIDE. FROM THE OPPOSITE STARBOARD
   DIRECTION, FULLY UNFASTENED FROM THE BARREL, COMES THE GREAT
   WHITE. FIRST THE FIN, THEN THE CONICAL NOSE AND THE UPPER
   BORDER OF WIDE, GRINNING TEETH. IT KNIFES THROUGH THE WATER
   IN ABSOLUTE SILENCE, PROPELLING ITSELF WITH TREMENDOUS SPEED
   TOWARD THE UNSUSPECTING MEN.

   CLOSE - BRODY

   HIS INSTINCTS SHINE -- AS DOES HIS NEWLY-ACQUIRED SENSE OF
   DIRECTION.

                         BRODY
                  (TOP OF HIS LUNGS)
             SHARK! STARBOARD!

   CLOSE - HOOPER AND QUINT

   THEY TURN JUST IN TIME, AND A LONG SPINE-STRETCH SAVES THEM
   FROM INSTANT DECAPITATION. THE GREAT WHITE PASSES THE TRANSOM,
   THE HARPOON STILL IN ITS SIDE AND TRAILING FIVE FEET OF CHEWED-
   OFF CABLE. IT ROLLS ON ITS SIDE AND LOOKS AT THEM AS IT
   PASSES.

   PAST THE STERN THE HUGE TAIL LASHES OUT, RIPPING THE ROPE
   OUT OF QUINT'S HANDS, SHEARING A HUGE SWATH THROUGH THE PAINT,
   PEELING IT OFF LIKE A PLANE, TAKING ONE OF THE BRONZE LETTERS
   OUT OF "ORCA." THE SHARK BEGINS AN ARC TO SEA, ITS FIN CUTTING
   THE WATER, AND STARTS CIRCLING THE BOAT. QUINT NOTICES HIS
   CUT HAND, PALM BLEEDING, REALIZING HOW CLOSE HE CAME TO LOSING
   IT.

                         QUINT
                  (TO HOOPER)
             HAUL IN THAT ROPE -- IT'LL FOUL US!
                  (THEN TO BRODY ON THE
                  BRIDGE)
             START THE ENGINE!

   THE DIESELS START WITH A TERRIBLE GRINDING.

                         QUINT
             EASY! IT'LL TEAR RIGHT OUT!

                         HOOPER
                  (HAULING)
             THE SHAFT IS GIVING.

   HOOPER SLAMS THE HATCH, KICKS THE TOOLS TO ONE SIDE, CLEARING
   THE DECK FOR ACTION ONCE AGAIN.

                         BRODY
                  (ON BRIDGE)
             THAT'S IT! RADIO IN FOR HELP!

                         QUINT
             SHUT UP! JUST PUMP HER OUT!

                         BRODY
                  (COMING DOWN OFF THE
                  BRIDGE)
             YEAH, CAPTAIN, AS SOON AS I MAKE A
             CALL.

   BRODY HEADS FOR THE RADIO IN THE PILOT HOUSE.

   QUINT - CLOSE

   A PERFECTLY TERRIBLE LOOK COMES OVER HIM. HE RAISES UP AND
   STARTS AFTER BRODY. BRODY DISAPPEARS INTO THE CABIN. QUINT
   PAUSES OUTSIDE AND SEES:

   INSERT - QUINT'S LEAD-CENTERED BASEBALL BAT

   HIS CALLOUSED HAND GRABS IT UP FIERCELY.

   INT. RADIO SHACK

   BRODY PICKS UP THE RADIO, FLICKING ON KNOBS AND LIGHTS ON
   THE COMPLEX CONSOLE.

                         QUINT (O.S.)
             BEG YOUR PARDON --

   ANGLE - DOORWAY

   QUINT APPEARS, SILHOUETTED IN THE HOT LIGHT OF THE DOOR,
   RAISING HIS BAT.

                         QUINT
             DUTY FIRST AND PLEASURE AFTER --

   CLOSE - BRODY

   LOOKING UP IN HORROR, COVERING HIS FACE.

   CLOSE - QUINT

   QUINT BRINGS DOWN THE BAT WITH ALL THE STRENGTH HE CAN SUMMON.

   CRASH!

   SPARKS FLY, LIGHTS BLINK AND GO OUT, PLASTIC AND SECTIONS OF
   METAL RICOCHET ALL OVER THE CABIN AS QUINT DEMOLISHES THE
   SHIP-TO-SHORE RADIO.

   QUINT TAKES A HAPPY BREATH, WINKS AT BRODY AND HANDS HIM THE
   BAT.

                         QUINT
             EXCUSE ME!

   BRODY'S ADRENALINE TURNS HIS FEAR INTO RAGE. HIS GLASSES ARE
   CRACKED OR BROKEN BY FLYING PIECES OF RADIO. HE SEIZES THE
   BAT, AND POUND THE SHATTERED RADIO FOR EMPHASIS.

                         BRODY
             SOME GREAT IDEA! NOW WHERE ARE WE?
             SOME GODDAMN SKIPPER YOU ARE. YOU'RE
             CERTIFIABLE, Y'KNOW THAT? YOU'RE A
             REAL TREAT! CERTIFIABLE! BANANAS!

   HIS TIRADE IS INTERRUPTED BY AN URGENT BELLOW FROM HOOPER.

   CLOSE - HOOPER

   POINTING AT THE FIN.

                         HOOPER
             COMING RIGHT TO US!

                         QUINT
             NO -- COMIN' RIGHT AT US! SLOW AHEAD,
             HE'LL HIT US HEAD ON --
                  (THE ENGINE CLANKS)
             SLOWER! THROTTLE BACK ---

   ANGLE - OVER THE BOW

                         QUINT
                  (RAISING HARPOON)
             HARD TO PORT!

   HOOPER PULLS THE BOAT INTO A TIGHT TURN AND QUINT HAS A SHOT
   AT THE UPWARD ROLLING FLANK. HE SINKS IT WITH CAREFUL
   PRECISION.

                         QUINT
             TRY SHAKIN' THAT OUT!

   BRODY EMERGES FROM THE CABIN AS THE ROPE ZIPS OVERBOARD, AND
   THE BARREL, CHANGING OVER, CATAPULTS INTO THE AIR BEFORE
   PLUNGING INTO THE OCEAN IN A CLOUDY SPLASH.

                         BRODY
                  (SHOUTING TO QUINT)
             DID YOU GET HIM IN THE HEAD?

                         QUINT
                  (TO BRODY)
             NO! NO! NO!
                  (TO HOOPER)
             SWING AROUND! AFTER HIM!

   ON THE FLYBRIDGE

   HOOPER CAN SEE THE FIN RACING AHEAD OF THE BARREL. DIVING
   DOWN. UP AGAIN -- QUINT PREPARES ANOTHER IRON. BRODY IS
   DIGGING IN HIS BAG. HE COMES UP WITH HIS 2" .357 SERVICE
   REVOLVER.

                         QUINT
             MORE GAS... GO TO HALF! GET ME RIGHT
             ALONGSIDE HIM --

   THE ENGINE THUDS AND KNOCKS.

                         HOOPER
                  (SHOUTING DOWN)
             WE CAN'T REV IT UP THIS HIGH --

   SUDDENLY THE BARREL GONGS INTO THE SIDE OF THE ORCA.

                         QUINT
             WATCH IT!

   HOOPER SKILLFULLY AVOIDS THE SPEEDING ROPE.

                         QUINT
             ATTA BOY!

   QUINT LEANS TO ONE SIDE, HARPOON OVER HIS HEAD. THE GREAT
   WHITE BREAKS WATER AND...

                         QUINT
             TAKE TWO, THEY'RE SMALL!

   HE SINKS IT DEEP. WE HEAR SHOTS. AS THE NEW ROPE WHIPS OUT,
   BRODY CAN BE SEEN STANDING ON THE GUNWALE, IN REGULATION
   POLICE COMBAT PISTOL STANCE, HOLDING HIS .357 IN BOTH HANDS,
   FIRING AT THE SHARK'S HEAD.

   QUINT SHAKES HIS HEAD IN AMUSED DISBELIEF AT THIS, AS THE
   BARREL GOES OVER.

                         HOOPER
                  (SHOUTING AT BRODY)
             DON'T SHOOT HIM ANY MORE! HE'S CRAZY
             ON HIS OWN BLOOD ALREADY!

                         BRODY
             I CAN'T STAND HERE DOING NOTHING!

                         QUINT
             ORDER IN THE COURT!

   WATER LEVEL ANGLE

   HE HAS SEEN THE TWO BARRELS POP TO THE SURFACE.

                         QUINT
                  (RACING OVER)
             THREE'LL DO IT! HE'S HAVIN' TROUBLE
             WITH TWO!

   HE YELLS TO HOOPER AND BRODY AS HE SWINGS BEHIND THE CONTROLS.

                         QUINT
             GRAB YOURSELVES A COUPLE OF POLES!

   QUINT STEERS "SLOW AHEAD," ENGINE PROTESTING, AS HE MANEUVERS
   TOWARD THE MOVING BARRELS. QUINT PEERS DOWN, STEERING CLOSER
   AND CLOSER.

                         QUINT
             GET READY! NOW SNAG 'EM!

   TOGETHER BRODY AND HOOPER HOOK A BARREL-ROPE AND HOLD ON FOR
   DEAR LIFE AS THE SHARK CHANGES COURSE.

                         QUINT
             PULL IN THE ROPES AND TIE 'EM ONTO
             THE TRANSOM -- FREE RIDE.

   BRODY AND HOOPER PULL IN WITH ALL THEY ARE WORTH AS QUINT
   HELPS OUT BY WHEELING IN A CIRCLE. HE LAUGHS TO HIMSELF,
   ENJOYING THE SPECTACLE.

   CLOSE - HOOPER

   SECURING THE ROPE TO A CLEAT BUT ALLOWING THE BARREL TO HANG
   OVERBOARD. BRODY TIES HIS NOW-PERFECT BOWLINE ADJACENT CLEAT.

   WIDE ANGLE - ORCA

   THE BOAT IS JARRED VIOLENTLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE AS THE
   UNDERWATER FORCE OF THE GREAT WHITE JERKS AND HEAVES THEM TO
   AND FRO, UP AND DOWN, SIDE TO SIDE...

   ANGLE - HOOPER AND BRODY

   ARE BOTH TORN OFF THEIR FEET AS THE BOAT IS THRUST FORWARD.

   FLYBRIDGE - QUINT

   SEES THE FIN AHEAD. IT IS PULLING THE BOAT.

                         QUINT
             GET TIRED! THAT'S THE IDEA! HERE'S A
             LITTLE REVERSE FOR YOU!

   THE SHARK LEAPS PARTIALLY OUT OF THE WATER, AND THE SIGHT IS
   BOTH HORRIFYING AND AWESOME. ITS JAWS BREAK WATER, SNAPPING
   AT THE ROPES THAT HAVE HIM SNARLED AND FRUSTRATED.

   QUINT THROWS THE ORCA INTO NEUTRAL AND SHOUTS DOWN:

                         QUINT
             HAUL IN -- WATCH THE PROP!

   WITH THAT, QUINT SLIDES DOWN TO THE PROW, PUTTING ANOTHER
   SHAFT ONTO HIS GUN, FINDING SATISFACTION IN ITS HEFT AND
   BALANCE. THE SHARK CAN BE SEEN DIRECTLY AHEAD, THRESHING
   CLOSER.

                         QUINT
             NOW! UNTIE 'EM! QUICK! HE'LL TEAR US
             TO PIECES.

   HE FIRES THE IRON, AND THE SHARK VEERS DOWNWARD IN A GUSHING
   SHOWER OF SPRAY.

   HOOPER AND BRODY

   THEY ARE TRYING TO UNTIE FROM THE CLEATS, BUT BOTH ROPES ARE
   STRETCHED TOO TAUT. THEY JUMP OUT OF THE WAY, FALLING FLAT

   ON THE DECK AS THE ROPES SWEEP OVER THEM, KNOCKING OVER
   OBJECTS, SKEETERING ACROSS THE DECK. A TIGHT JERKING MOTION,
   AND THE ORCA IS DRAGGED THROUGH THE WATER -- BACKWARDS. AND
   MUCH TOO FAST. WATER IS SPLASHING UP OVER THE TRANSOM IN ITS
   BACKWARD WAKE. THE ENGINES GROAN AND COMPLAIN.

                         QUINT
             DAMN HEAD IS TOO FAR AWAY. HE'S TOO
             BIG.

   WRENCHED TO ONE SIDE, QUINT IS KNOCKED FROM HIS FEET.

   CLOSE - THE TWO CLEATS

   A MOMENT OF SLACKNESS, AND THEN A GREAT SURGE OF RAW STRENGTH.

   THE ROPE SNAPS THE CLEATS OFF, SCREWS AND SPLINTERED WOOD
   SPRAYING -- AND THE BARRELS FLY OVER THE WATER. THEY DISAPPEAR
   BENEATH THE TURBULENT GREY SURFACE.

   THE THREE MEN, BREATHING HEAVILY, BRUISED AND POURING SWEAT,
   LOOK OUT AT THE BLANK WATER.

   ANGLE - OCEAN

   POP -- POP -- POP. ONE, TWO, THREE, THE BARRELS SURFACE --
   READY FOR MORE.

                         QUINT
                  (AMAZED AT THE SHARK'S
                  STRENGTH)
             HE CAN'T GO SO DEEP. NOT WITH ALL
             THOSE ON HIM.

   BRODY LOOKS DOWN AT HIS FEET. THERE IS SALT WATER UP TO THEIR
   SHOE TOPS.

                         BRODY
             WHAT ABOUT US?

                         QUINT
                  (MENTALLY ASSESSING
                  THE DAMAGE)
             HAVE TO PUMP HER STEADY, S'ALL.

   THE BARRELS START A WIDE CIRCLE, EACH CUTS THROUGH THE WATER,
   PUSHING A WAVE BEFORE IT AND LEAVING A WAKE BEHIND.

                         QUINT
                  (TO HOOPER)
             FOLLOW HIM --
                  (TO BRODY)
             YOU START PUMPIN' OUT HERE.

   QUINT TOSSES BRODY THE HAND PUMP, THEN PICKS UP HIS M-1, AND
   CHECKS THE LOAD.

                         HOOPER (O.S.)
                  (ON BRIDGE)
             HE'S HEADING UNDER -- !

                         QUINT
                  (INCREDULOUSLY)
             NO WAY! HE CAN'T!

   ANGLE - OCEAN

   THE BARRELS APPROACHING THE ORCA DIP BELOW THE SURFACE, ONE --
   TWO -- THREE.

                         BRODY
             WHERE'D HE GO?

   BRODY LOOKS AROUND. HOOPER ON THE FLYING BRIDGE SEARCHING IN
   ALL DIRECTIONS. QUINT IS LOOKING MORE APPALLED EVERY SECOND.

                         QUINT
                  (HELPLESSLY)
             HE CAN'T STAY DOWN WITH THREE BARRELS
             ON HIM! WHERE IS HE?!

                         BRODY
             HAVE YOU EVER HAD ONE DO THIS?

                         QUINT
                  (AND HE MEANS THIS)
             NO!

   BOOMING THUD AT THE KEEL. BRODY SLIDES ON THE WET DECK AND
   QUINT LOSES HIS FOOTING, FALLING INTO BRODY'S ARMS.

   WITH HOOPER ON THE FLY BRIDGE

   IT SEEMS THE ONLY PLACE OUT OF REACH OF THE SHARK. QUINT
   CLIMBS UP, BRODY FOLLOWING HIM, RELOADING HIS PISTOL.

   JUST THEN, THE BARRELS POP UP AHEAD, VEER LEFT, AND DUCK
   UNDER.

                         QUINT
             FOLLOW HIM!

                         HOOPER
             HE'S UNDER!

   BRODY AND HIS POINT OF VIEW

                         BRODY
             THERE!
                  (POINTS WILDLY)

   THE BARRELS HAVE SURFACED AND WE SEE THE MONSTER SHADOW
   SLIDING UNDER THE ORCA, SEEMINGLY ENDLESS. VIOLENT SCRAPING
   SOUNDS.

                         BRODY
             HE'S TRYING TO SINK US!

                         QUINT
                  (TO HOOPER)
             DEAD ASTERN! ZIG-ZAG!

   QUINT IS GRIMLY SILENT. BRODY SENSES THAT QUINT IS IN THE
   FIGHT OF (AND FOR) HIS LIFE.

   THE ORCA TAKING EVASIVE ACTION. BUT THE THREE BARRELS ARE
   CLOSING THE GAP, THE ENGINES COUGHING AND MISSING, DESTROYING
   THEMSELVES WITH EVERY ROTATION OF THE DAMAGED SHAFT.

             BRODY
     HE'S CHASING US! I
     DON'T BELIEVE IT.

                                           QUINT
                                   FULL THROTTLE! TO PORT!

   ANGLE ON THE BRIDGE

   HOOPER IS JAMMING THE THROTTLE FORWARD, BUT THE ENGINE IS
   POUNDING AND KNOCKING WILDLY. THE BARRELS CIRCLE AND MOVE
   IN. QUINT HAS HIS RIFLE READY.

                         HOOPER
                  (SUDDENLY GIVING QUINT
                  THE WHEEL)
             HOLD HER.

   HE LEAPS TO HIS GEAR, TRYING DESPERATELY TO GET HIS DART
   GUN.

   JUST THEN, THE SHARK ATTACKS, BREAKING WATER AND RISING OVER
   THE BOAT LIKE A ROCKET; SNOUT, JAWS, PECTORAL FINS, BELLY,
   FALLING SIDEWAYS. A VAST SPRAY DRENCHES THE MEN. QUINT FIRES
   INTO THE BELLY, THE BULLETS POCKING THE SMOOTH WHITENESS.

                         HOOPER
                  (LOADING)
             KEEP HIM THERE! KEEP HIM!

   THE ORCA SHUDDERS FROM SIDE TO SIDE. FROM HOOPER'S POINT OF
   VIEW WE CAN THE SHARK GRIPPING THE TRANSOM IN HIS JAWS,
   SHAKING THE BOAT AS HE SAWS HIS MASSIVE HEAD FROM SIDE TO
   SIDE, TRYING TO TEAR A CHUNK OUT OF THE VERY HULL. QUINT HAS
   RELOADED AND IS FIRING INTO THE FISH. BRODY HAS A WICKED
   POINTED GAFF, AND IS SWINGING WILDLY AT THE SNOUT, GASHING
   AND GOUGING IT, TRYING FOR THE EYES. THE KILLING LUST IS ON
   ALL THREE MEN.

                         QUINT
             THROTTLING BACK!

   THE BOAT SURGES, THE SHARK GIVES A FINAL UNBALANCES WRENCH,
   AND DISENGAGES. THE DORSAL FIN CIRCLES OFF, BEGINNING A WIDE
   LOOP AROUND THE BOAT.

   THE ENGINE QUIVERS AND DIES, THE BOAT WITHOUT POWER, ROLLING
   HALF AWASH, A WOUNDED VICTIM.

   THE FIN DIPS, THE BARRELS FOLLOW, THE SHARK DISAPPEARS BENEATH
   THE WAVES. THERE IS COMPLETE SILENCE.

   THE THREE MEN ON DECK

   IN THE DEAD QUIET, WE CAN HEAR THE LAP OF WAVES AGAINST THE
   HULL, THE HOARSE PANTING BREATHING OF THE MEN, THE PINGS AND
   POPS OF THE COOLING, DYING ENGINES.

   QUINT AND THE TRANSOM

   HE EYES THE STERN. HUGE CRACKS AND BROKEN TIMBER TESTIFY TO
   THE FURY OF THE ATTACK.

                         QUINT
                  (VERY QUIETLY, TO
                  HOOPER)
             WHAT CAN THAT GUN OF YOURS DO?

                         HOOPER
             POWER HEAD WITH 20 CCS OF STRYCHNINE
             NITRATE. IF I CAN HIT HIM. I CAN
             KILL HIM. BUT I GOTTA BE CLOSE.
             VERY CLOSE.

                         BRODY
                  (THE AWFUL REALIZATION)
             YOU GOTTA GO IN THE WATER...

                                                        CUT TO:

   ON DECK, LATER

   QUINT AND HOOPER ARE ASSEMBLING THE SHARK CAGE, ITS SHINY
   BARS THE ONLY UNDAMAGED THINGS ON DECK. BRODY IS WORKING
   TOO, BOLTING THE SECTIONS TOGETHER.

                         HOOPER
                  (IN COMMAND NOW)
             RIG THE CABLE TO THE ROOF EYEBOLTS.

   THE MEN ARE SPEAKING IN NEAR WHISPERS, QUIET IN THE SILENCE
   THAT SURROUNDS THEM. HOOPER IS IN HIS WET SUIT, ADJUSTING
   WEIGHTS, MASK, TANKS, ETC. THE CAGE IS STANDING IN THE STERN.

   QUINT RUNS A LINE FROM THE GIN POLE TO THE ROOF SECTION.

   HOOPER CLIMBS IN THOUGH THE TOP.

                         HOOPER
             TAKE ME UP.

   BRODY CRANKS THE WINCH, HOISTING CAGE AND HOOPER INTO THE
   AIR. QUINT BALANCES THE GIN POLE LINES, HOOPER CROUCHING IN
   THE CAGE, EXAMINING IT FOR STRESSES; SATISFIED, HE HOLDS OUT
   HIS HAND. QUINT PUTS THE SPEAR GUN INTO IT.

   CLOSE ON HOOPER IN THE CAGE

   HE EXAMINES HIS WEAPON, CHECKING THE POWER LOAD, WITH THE
   BIG WICKED-LOOKING SYRINGE HEAD UNCAPPED TO REVEAL ITS RAZOR
   POINT.

                         HOOPER
             LOWER AWAY, CHIEF.
                  (THEN, TO QUINT)
             TRY AND KEEP HIM OFF ME TILL I'M
             UNDER.

   HOOPER INSIDE, LOOKING OUT THE BARS OF THE CAGE, GIVES BRODY
   A REASSURING SMILE, THEN POPS HIS MOUTHPIECE BETWEEN HIS
   TEETH AND CHECKS HIS REGULATOR. BRODY STEPS BACK, AND WITH
   QUINT GUIDING THE CAGE, BEGINS LOWERING IT OFF THE GIN POLE
   BOOM ARM INTO THE SEA ALONGSIDE THE BOAT.

   BRODY AND HOOPER STARE AT EACH ANOTHER AS THEIR FACES PASS,
   HOOPER SLIDING DOWN INTO THE COLD GREY OCEAN.

   AS HOOPER DISAPPEARS BENEATH THE SURFACE, QUINT AND BRODY
   EXCHANGE A LONG LOOK BETWEEN THEM.

   UNDERWATER - CAGE

   HOOPER'S POINT OF VIEW

   SUBMERGING. THE SKY, HORIZON, WATER LINE, CLEAN FRESH SEA
   AIR THEN... THE MAGNIFICENT INNERSPACES, WITH BUBBLES
   SPARKLING IN FRONT OF US.

   ANGLE - HOOPER IN THE CAGE

   AS HE FLOATS TO TWENTY FEET HOOPER NEVER STOPS LOOKING AROUND
   360 DEGREES. HE REMOVES THE RUBBER GUARD FROM THE NEEDLE AND
   WAITS.

   EXT. THE SURFACE - BRODY AND QUINT

   THEIR TURNING HEADS TELL US THAT THE BARRELS ARE STILL
   CIRCLING.

   SUDDENLY, BOTH HEADS STOP TURNING.

   THE SEA

   THE BARRELS HAVE COME TO A STOP. DELICATELY, THEY CHANGE
   COURSE AND MEANDER TOWARD THE LOWERED CAGE.

   UNDERWATER - HOOPER

   HIS BACK IS TO US. HE IS JUST NOW COMPLETING A VISUAL SWEEP
   AND TURNS, EYES FRONT INTO CLOSEUP AND: FIXES WILDLY ON
   SOMETHING MONSTROUS... AND FASCINATING.

   HOOPER'S POINT OF VIEW

   THE WATER IS CLEAR AND SHAFTS OF SUNLIGHT STREAK DOWNWARD IN
   THE BLUE. FROM THE DEEP GLOOM -- DIVING SLOWLY, SMOOTHLY --
   COMES THE SHARK. IT MOVES WITH NO APPARENT EFFORT, SINUOUS
   BEYOND COMPARISON. AS IT NEARS THE CAGE, IT TURNS, AND ITS
   GHASTLY LENGTH PASSES RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM: FIRST THE SNOUT,
   THEN THE JAW, SLACK AND SMILING, THEN THE BLACK EYE.

   HOOPER TENTATIVELY REACHES OUT. IT IS TOO FAR FOR THE
   STRYCHNINE POLE. THE VINYL FLESH IS POCKED WITH BULLET HOLES,
   IRON SCARS, GAFFING HOOKS AND STRANGE OPEN WOUNDS THAT TINGE
   THE PASSING CURRENTS WITH PINK.

   SURFACE

   THE TRAILING BARRELS GONG AND SCRATCH THE KEEL OF THE ORCA
   ABOVE. BRODY AND QUINT LEAP BACK.

   HOOPER - CLOSE

   THE SHARK HAS VANISHED INTO A CLOUD OF RISING SILT. HOOPER,
   EXPECTING THE SHARK TO ATTACK OUT OF THAT SAME GENERAL
   DIRECTION, BRACES HIMSELF, POLE EXTENDED THROUGH THE BARS,
   BREATHING FASTER, STRAINING HIS EYES INTO THE GLOOM AND...
   WE SEE THAT THE SHARK ATTACKING FROM BEHIND HIM.

   THE CAGE IS SENT CAREENING. HOOPER GRABS THE BARS FOR DEAR
   LIFE. THE SHARK HAS GRABBED THE STEEL STRUTS IN ITS BRUTAL
   JAWS, SHAKING THE CAGE RELENTLESSLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE, BENDING
   THE BARS LIKE CLOTHES HANGERS. HOOPER CAN'T TURN THE POINTED
   END OF THE POLE AROUND, HIS BODY JAMMED AS FAR AWAY FROM THE
   NON-RATIONAL ATTACKER AS POSSIBLE.

   HOOPER IS TRAPPED.

   THE SHARK WITHDRAWS TO GET SOME RUNNING ROOM THEN CHARGES
   AGAIN. THE BLEEDING SNOUT THRUST DEEPER INTO THE YAWING BARS,
   THE JAWS SNAPPING AND TWISTING, TWO FEET FROM HOOPER'S TORSO,
   THE TAIL THRUSTING IT FORWARD. HOOPER DROPS THE STRYCHNINE
   POLE BETWEEN THE BARS AND IT TUMBLES SLOWLY TOWARD RAPTURE
   DEPTH.

   ALL THE SHARK NEEDS IS ONE MORE GOOD THRUST BEFORE SEPARATING
   HOOPER AT THE WAISTLINE. THROUGH FRANTIC BUBBLES HOOPER
   FUMBLES WITH THE OVERHEAD HATCH COVER, KICKING UP AND OUT OF
   THE CAGE. THE SHARK BACKPEDALS WITH ITS TAIL, BUT THE BROAD
   HEAD WON'T SHAKE LOOSE.

   HOOPER RUSHES DOWNWARDS, AFTER THE STRYCHNINE POLE.

   ANGLE - SHARK

   THE SHARK TWISTS FREE OF THE CAGE AND ARROWS DOWNWARD AFTER
   HOOPER.

   HOOPER NEARLY RECOVERS THE POLE. AGAIN IT SLIPS FROM HIS
   FRIGHTENED GRASP AND THIS TIME DISAPPEARS INTO A NARROW ABYSS.
   HOOPER TURNS AND LOOKS UP.

   THE GREAT WHITE IS LUNGING AT HIM, TWENTY FEET ABOVE.

   SURFACE

   ONE OF THE BARREL ROPES SNAKES AROUND THE CAGE ROPE AND PULLS
   TAUT.

   HOOPER - DEEP

   TURNING TO MEET THE MONSTER WHICH -- THOUGH HELD BACK FOR A
   MOMENT BY THE SNARLED ROPE -- NOW SURGES FORWARD.

   SURFACE - BRODY AND QUINT

   THE ORCA IS LISTING DANGEROUSLY AFT, THE GINPOLE BENT ALMOST
   TO THE BREAKING POINT. BRODY IS IN A FRENZY TRYING TO HAUL
   UP THE CAGE. QUINT ATTACHES THE END OF BRODY'S ROPE TO A
   HAND-WINCH. THE GINPOLE IS SPLITTING.

                         QUINT
             LET GO OF IT!

   THE POLE GIVES WAY, THE ROPE WHIPPING DOWN ON THE GUNWALE...
   THE PULLING OF THE TONNAGE BELOW IS TIPPING THE ORCA, DRAGGING
   IT, BUT QUINT WON'T GIVE UP THE WINCH. BRODY HAULS ON THE
   ROPE BAREHANDED.

   UNDERWATER - HOOPER

   MANEUVERING DOWNWARD, AWAY FROM THE JAWS... SUDDENLY THE
   CRAZED SHARK VEERS UPWARD FOR THE SURFACE.

   SURFACE - QUINT

   THE WINCH IS WORKING FASTER NOW, QUINT DEMONICALLY WINDING
   IT IN. THE CRUSHED CAGE BANGS AGAINST THE HULL THEN BREAKS
   WATER.

   BRODY IS HORRIFIED. THE CAGE IS EMPTY!

             QUINT
        (A HORRIBLE SCREAM)
     HE'S COMIN' UP -- !

                                           BRODY
                                   HE'S TAKEN HIM!

   MASTER ANGLE

   THE SHARK BREAKS WATER RIGHT BESIDE THE ORCA, RISING WITH A
   GREAT WHOOSHING NOISE. IT RISES VERTICALLY, TOWERING OVERHEAD,
   BLOCKING OUT THE SUN. THE PECTORAL FINS SEEM TO REACH FORWARD.
   THE SHARK, IN ALL OF ITS MONSTROUS GLORY, FALLS ONTO THE
   STERN OF THE BOAT WITH A SHATTERING CRASH, NARROWLY MISSING
   QUINT AND BRODY. IT DRIVES THE STERN UNDERWATER, THE OCEAN
   POURS IN OVER THE TRANSOM. THE JAWS SNAP FROM SIDE TO SIDE.
   BRODY FLOUNDERS BACKWARDS AWAY FROM IT.

   CLOSE - BRODY

   HE IS CLINGING TO THE MAST FOR DEAR LIFE, AS THE SHIP BEGINS
   TO TILT TO STERN, AND EVERYTHING STARTS TO BREAK LOOSE AROUND
   HIM.

   NIGHTMARE ANGLE - DECK OF THE ORCA

   THE GIANT JAWS ARE SNAPPING IRRESISTIBLY AT EVERYTHING: GREAT
   CHUNKS OF WOOD TORN OUT OF THE DECK AND SUPERSTRUCTURE.

   DECK CHAIR, IRONS, ROPE, GEAR, BEERCANS, BOTTLES, BRODY'S
   BAG, ALL ARE FOOD FOR THE INSATIABLE MAW BLINDLY CHURNING
   AWAY.

   QUINT IS CLINGING NEXT TO A RACK OF LANCES: HE IS ENRAGED AT
   THIS ULTIMATE VIOLATION OF HIS TERRITORY. HE SNATCHES UP A
   LANCE AND HURLS HIMSELF AT THE SHARK WITH A WORDLESS BELLOW.

   THE GREAT HEAD WEAVES SIDE TO SIDE, THE DECK IS AT A
   TREACHEROUS INCLINE, SLIPPERY WITH BLOOD AND SEAWATER. QUINT'S
   FOOTING FALTERS AND SLIPS, HE STUMBLES AT THE MOUTH OF HELL,
   THE BIG TEETH SEIZE HIM AND SNAP.

   QUINT'S ROAR OF RAGE AND PAIN IS CHOKED OFF AS HIS BODY IS
   CLAMPED BETWEEN THE GRINDING, SAWING TEETH, AND HIS HEAD AND
   LEGS SUDDENLY CONTORT AS THE SHARK'S TEETH MEET ACROSS HIS
   TORSO. BLOOD GUSHES ONTO THE DECK. THE REMNANTS OF HIS BODY
   TUMBLE FROM THE SHARK'S MOUTH.

   BRODY SEES THE HORROR, HEARS THE SCREAMS -- IN HIS
   DESPERATION, HE TEARS LOOSE ONE OF HOOPER'S REMAINING AIR
   TANKS, AND HURLS IT AT THE MONSTER. IT TUMBLES INTO THE BLOODY
   WELL, WEDGING ACROSS THE BACK OF THE MOUTH, THE THICK STEEL
   BLOCKING THE CRUEL JAWS.

   THE SHARK'S HEAD SHAKES EVEN MORE VIOLENTLY, TRYING TO CLEAR
   THE COLD IRON, BUT THE TANK IS IN TO STAY.

   DECK OF THE ORCA, LISTING BADLY

   TO AVOID SLIDING INTO THE JAWS, BRODY SCRAMBLES ON THE TITLING
   DECK, BRACING HIMSELF IN THE CABIN DOOR TO AVOID PITCHING
   DOWN INTO THE BLOODY MOUTH. HE FIGHTS HIS WAY INTO THE CABIN,
   ALREADY A SHAMBLES.

   BELOW HIM, ON THE DECK, THE SHARK LUNGES AGAIN, SHIFTING
   WEIGHT SO THAT THE BOAT IN NOW STERN DOWN, AND LISTING TO
   THE SIDE. WATER FROM THE SEA POURS INTO THE CABIN.

   ANOTHER LUNGE BY THE SHARK. THE HUGE SNOUT AND JAWS SLAM UP
   AGAINST THE DOORFRAME, BLOCKING ESCAPE, BLOODY, GNASHING.

   MORE SEAWATER. TO STAY IN THE CABIN IS TO GO DOWN WITH THE
   SHIP.

   BRODY CLAMBERS AS FAR FROM THE SHARK AS HE CAN, AGAINST THE
   FORWARD WALL OF THE PILOTHOUSE. HE SEES THE WINDOW HOOPER
   USED BEFORE. IT'S BLOCKED BY BARRELS AND DEBRIS. HE BREAKS
   THE SIDE WINDOW HIGHEST ABOVE THE WATER, EDGES OUT ONTO THE
   BATTERED BRIDGE.

   THE SHARK ROLLS AROUND, NOW HALF IN THE WATER. THE SHIP IS
   SINKING, THE SEA IS NOT A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE. BRODY CLIMBS
   UP INTO THE FLYING BRIDGE.

   THE SHARK IS STILL LUNGING AND SNAPPING. BRODY IS FORCED TO
   CLIMB HIGHER AND HIGHER AS THE SHIP SLOWLY SINKS BENEATH
   HIM.

   CLOSE - BRODY

   HE SCRAMBLES FOR HIS LIFE ONTO THE FLYING BRIDGE, SEES THE M-
   1 STUCK THERE, SEIZES IT.

   OVER BRODY, LOOKING DOWN AT THE STERN

   HE IS BRACING HIMSELF, AIMING THE RIFLE, TAKING A BEAD ON
   THE STEEL TANKS, SILVER GLEAMING IN THE BLOODY SHARK'S MOUTH.
   HE FIRES. AND FIRES. BULLETS SHATTER THE SHARK'S TEETH,
   PUNCHING HOLES IN THE DRIPPING SNOUT.

   WIDE ON THE ORCA  EXPLOSION

   WITH A MUFFLED BOOM, THE PERFECT SYMMETRY OF THE SHARK IS
   SUDDENLY BLOWN APART IN A GEYSER OF STEEL AND BLOOD AS BRODY'S
   SHOT HITS THE PRESSURIZED TANK. A 30-FOOT CLOUD OF WATER,
   STEEL, SHARK AND DEBRIS COVERS THE SKY.

   A GIGANTIC CONVULSION HURLS THE GREAT WHITE'S MANGLED BODY
   INTO THE SEA. THE ORCA SLOWLY BEGINS TO TURN OVER IN ITS
   DEATH ROLL.

   UNDERWATER

   THE SHARK'S CARCASS FLOATING DOWN IN A CLOUD OF BLOOD AND
   DEBRIS.

   A SHADOW CLOUDS THE WATERS, AND THE ORCA'S MASS BEGINS TO
   SLIP INTO THE FRAME.

   CLOSE - HOOPER

   EMERGING FROM BENEATH THE SURFACE, HE RAISES HIS MASK, SPITS
   OUT HIS MOUTHPIECE AND KICKS TOWARD BRODY.

   SURFACE - BRODY AND HOOPER

   BRODY IS HOLDING ONTO A CUSHION, BARELY AFLOAT, RELIEVED THE
   SHARK IS DEAD, YET STUNNED TO SEE HOOPER IS STILL ALIVE. THE
   TWO MEN SHARE WEAK LAUGHTER, WHICH SOON TRAILS OFF.

                         HOOPER
             QUINT...?

                         BRODY
             NO...
                  (NOTICES SOMETHING
                  O.S.)
             YOU THINK WE CAN GET BACK WITH THOSE?

   SURFACE - BRODY AND HOOPER - ANOTHER ANGLE

   THEY SWIM THROUGH THE DEBRIS, USING TWO BARRELS AS FLOATS,
   AS DOZENS OF SEAGULLS FEAST ON SHARK REMAINS ON THE SURFACE.

                         BRODY
             WHAT DAY IS THIS?

                         HOOPER
             WEDNESDAY... NO, IT'S TUESDAY, I
             THINK.

                         BRODY
             THINK THE TIDE'S WITH US?

                         HOOPER
             JUST KEEP KICKING.

                         BRODY
             Y'KNOW, I USED TO HATE THE WATER...

                         HOOPER
             I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY.

                                                   DISSOLVE TO:

   HIGH SHOT FROM SHORE

   THE TWO TINY, MISERABLE HEROES SWIM ASHORE AS THE CREDITS
   ROLL.

                                                      FADE OUT:

                             THE END
